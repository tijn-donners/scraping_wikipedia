Jan van Aken,Q6150343,"Jan van Aken (1614 – 25 March 1661 (buried)) was a Dutch Golden Age painter and engraver.  Van Aken was born and died in Amsterdam, but has been frequently confused with the celebrated German painter Johann van Achen of Cologne. Not much is known of his paintings but Bartsch enumerates twenty-one of his etchings, which are touched in the manner of Herman Saftleven. They are very slight but display great mastery.  Houbraken describes an etching by him from his own design, which he says is very scarce. He terms it the Travellers On Horseback. It is marked  ""J.V Aken, inv. et fec."". Among those mentioned are six horses after Pieter van Laer or Bamboccio and six views of the Rhine after Saftleven.  He was also influenced by Philips Wouwerman.",male,Kampen,Amsterdam
Jan van Almeloveen,Q3806956,"Jan van Almeloveen (1656 – 1684) was a Dutch painter, engraver, and draughtsman of the 17th century, principally known for some neatly executed etchings of landscapes.  He was born in Mijdrecht, according to an inscription on his 1678 mezzotint portrait of his father, Johannes ab Almeloveen, a preacher in that city. He made 38 prints in total, all of which are etchings, mostly landscapes, including Dutch villages and rivers. Twenty of his landscape prints are based on the work of Dutch painter Herman Saftleven, with twelve depicting Dutch villages, and a series of four diamond-shaped prints of the Four Seasons. The other prints were created from his own designs and are less lively in composition. He died sometime after 1683, the year written on his last known print.  His Landscape with Harvesters illustrates the mid-17th-century shift in Dutch landscape art from a fascination with agricultural work that was prevalent in the 16th century, to a recreational interest in the scenery and the pleasures of country life.",male,Mijdrecht,Utrecht
Juriaen Ambdis,Q96091845,"Juriaen Ambdis was a 17th-century Dutch ship's gunner and painter. In 1648 he took service as gunner in the army of Safavid King (Shah) Abbas II (r. 1642-1666). He participated in the successful Siege of Kandahar during the Mughal–Safavid war (1649–53). After the siege, Ambdis and all other Dutchmen were discharged from service. However, unlike his fellow kinsmen, Ambdis decided to stay in Safavid Iran, reportedly eager to work as an artist. His decision was inspired by the extremely high salaries paid by the Safavids to Hendrick Boudewijn van Lockhorst, another Dutch painter. However, unlike Van Lockhorst, Ambdis was unsuccessful in making a name for himself, and almost fell into beggary. On 29 March 1649, an Iranian merchant had spotted Ambdis walking alone behind a caravan in Ottoman-held Iraq, and had given him bread. On 22 May 1650, it was reported that Ambdis had converted to Islam in Baghdad. Ambdis subsequently disappears from historic records; he died sometime after 1650.",male,,

After that he mostly made paintings for wall decorations in stately homes, at which pursuit he was quite successful.  According to the RKD he was the son of the genre painter Cornelis Bisschop and brother of the bird painter Abraham Busschop. He became Terwesten's pupil in 1686 at the Confrerie Pictura.

Cornelia toe Boecop,Q19754744,"Cornelia toe Boecop (born 1551 – after 1629) was a Dutch fine art painter from the Dutch Republic. Her mother and older sister were also painters.  Cornelia toe Boecop was born in 1551 in Kampen into a wealthy family as one of five siblings. Her father was the city councilor Egbert toe Boecop and her mother was the famous painter Mechtelt van Lichtenberg.  Cornelia's older sister Margaretha toe Boecop also became a painter. The daughters were probably educated by their mother, as painting and drawing, like needlework and music, were part of a girl's education in high society at that time. Her first marriage was to Roric van Harderwijck before 1601 and after he died, she married Gerrit Boecop van Houwenberch. There were no known offspring from these marriages.  A portrait of a man from 1595 has been preserved. Based on the coat of arms that appears on the painting, he has been identified as a member of the Van der Vecht-van Zuilen van Nijevelt family. It is signed ""Iov. Cornelia toe Boecop me faecit an. 1595."" This inscription seems to indicate that Cornelia continued painting after she was married, just as her mother had. In addition, two other works, a ""Portrait of a Woman"" and a ""Crucifixion"" from 1593, have been preserved. After the restoration of the ""Crucifixion,"" a museum exhibition entitled “Depicted Suffering” was held at the Stedelijk Museum Kampen in 2006.  Cornelia toe Boecop is the only painter-daughter of Mechtelt van Lichtenberg who was mentioned by Johan van Beverwijck in his work Van de wtnementheyt des Vrouwelicken genera, (On the excellence of the female sex) published in 1643. He praised her mother, who he identified as Mechtelt Boecop, as a talented painter, and said: ""her daughter Cornelia van Boecop also understood the same art, and she was still alive, being very old, in the year 1629."" Her life remains unknown apart from her two marriages and remaining works of art.  She lived much of her life in Kampen and died sometime between 1630 and 1634 in Sint-Michielsgestel.  Four of Cornelia's works are known to exist.",female,Kampen,Sint-Michielsgestel
Gesina ter Borch,Q1519218,"Gesina ter Borch (Deventer 15 November 1631 –  Zwolle 16 April 1690) was a Dutch Golden Age watercolorist and draftswoman, whose work mostly consists of watercolor paintings in albums. Most of her work captured her observations of family life, current events, and fashionable people. In addition to the visual arts, she wrote love poetry.  Gesina ter Borch was born on 15 November 1631 in Deventer in the Dutch Republic. She was the first child of the third marriage of Gerard ter Borch the Elder, who taught her to draw and paint. Her father was a draftsman and artist, but became a customs collector of commercial trade with the title of license master, working on the border between the Holy Roman Empire and the Dutch Republic. He trained her older and younger brothers more formally but Gesina was well educated for a woman of her time and class, learning to read, write and study the art of calligraphy (seen as suitable endeavours for well-born women). She also studied music and learned to draw. Her half-brother Gerard ter Borch II enjoyed artistic success and corresponded with Gesina frequently. After the loss of her younger brother, Moses, in the Battle of Landguard Fort, part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667), Gesina's work conveyed her deep sadness.  Gesina ter Borch was successful during her artistic career, although given her relatively high social class, she did not have to work as an artist for a living. Her earliest dated piece is from 1648, when she was 17 years old.  She also collaborated with her older half-brother Gerard in a few of his pieces. Gesina was a model for many of the ladies that are depicted in Gerard's works Ladies in Satin. Gerard considered Gesina his favorite model for these works. Gesina became a successful watercolorist. During her lifetime, she collected love poetry, and she made illustrations to coincide with it as well. Some albums of her work even included pieces dedicated to songs about love.  Only two paintings by Gesina ter Borch are known, with the only signed painting being discovered only in 2024, three watercolor albums survive, as well as 59 loose sheets of drawings. Her work was not widely known during her lifetime, because she was an amateur rather than a professional artist. Between ages 14 and 15, Gesina began her first album, Materi-boeck. Between 1652 and 1660, she produced a second album with 116 sheets containing songs, poems, and illustrations.   Ter Borch lived her entire life on the Sassenstraat in Zwolle, where she died on 16 April 1690. In 1660, she became friends with Henrik Jordis, a merchant from Amsterdam and an amateur poet. This resulted in courtship but she did not marry.  Only a few paintings by Gesina ter Borch are known, with the only signed painting discovered only in 2024. Three watercolor albums survive, as well as 59 loose sheets of drawings. Her work was not widely known during her lifetime, because she was an amateur rather than a professional artist. Between ages 14 and 15, Gesina began her first album of illustrated poetry and calligraphy of moralizing verses, the Materi-boeck.  Between 1652 and 1660, she produced a second album with 116 sheets containing songs, poems, and illustrations.  In 1882 art historian Abraham Bredius rediscovered the family’s albums compiled by Gesina ter Borch and they were acquired by the Rijksmuseum. For well over a century the albums were used as a source for information about ter Borch's more famous brother Gerhard, until art historians Alison Kettering and Hans Luijten began to study them from interest in Gesina ter Borch herself. Gesina acted as archivist and curator of the family's collections, and she appeared as a model for her brother's genre paintings.  In March of 2021 Ter Borch's work was added to the ""Gallery of Honor"" at the Rijksmuseum. Ter Borch, Judith Leyster, and Rachel Ruysch were the first women artists to be included in the gallery.  In 2023, an antique dealer bought a portrait of a toddler he initially thought was a likeness of Prince William III but which on further investigation was discovered to be the only known signed painting by Gesina ter Borch. It was acquired by the Rijksmuseum for over 3 million euros.",female,Zwolle,Zwolle
Hendrick ter Brugghen,Q437233,"Hendrick Jansz ter Brugghen (or Terbrugghen; 1588 – 1 November 1629) was a Dutch painter of genre scenes and religious subjects.  He was one of the Dutch followers of Caravaggio – the so-called Utrecht Caravaggisti. Along with Gerrit van Hondhorst and Dirck van Baburen, Ter Brugghen was one of the most important Dutch painters to have been influenced by Caravaggio.  No references to Ter Brugghen written during his life have been identified. His father Jan Egbertsz ter Brugghen, originally from Overijssel, had moved to Utrecht, where he was appointed secretary to the Court of Utrecht by the Prince of Orange, William the Silent. He had been married to Sophia Dircx. In 1588, he became bailiff to the Provincial Council of Holland in The Hague, where Hendrick was born.  The earliest brief reference to the painter is in Het Gulden Cabinet (1661) of Cornelis de Bie, where he is mistakenly referred to as Verbrugghen. Another short account is found in the Teutsche Academie (1675) by Joachim von Sandrart, where he is referred to as Verbrug. Here we learn that he studied with Abraham Bloemaert, a Mannerist painter. Sandrart also refers to the painter's ""tiefsinnige, jedoch, schwermütige Gedanken in seinen Werken"" [profound, but melancholic thoughts in his works].  From this unsure footing, the artist's son Richard ter Brugghen sought to rehabilitate his father's reputation as a painter in the early 18th century. He secured a letter, dated 15 April 1707, from Adriaen van der Werff in Rotterdam, attesting to his appreciation of Hendrick's work. Later that year, on 5 August 1707, Richard presented the government council of Deventer with four paintings of the Evangelists, to be hung in the Town Hall as a permanent memorial to his father.  An engraving, in all likelihood commissioned by Richard ter Brugghen from Pieter Bodart, and based on an earlier drawing by Gerard Hoet, was put about in 1708. It shows an idealised portrait of Hendrick, the family coat-of-arms, and a printed caption translated from the Dutch as:  Born in Overijsel in 1588, travelled from Utrecht to Rome, and ten years later returned to Utrecht, married there, lived there interruptedly, and died at the age of 42 on 1st Nov. 1629; he was a great and famous history painter from life, painting life-size figures in the Italian manner, so very superior to all others that the famous P. P. Rubens on travelling through the Netherlands declared on coming to Utrecht that he had found only one painter, namely Henricus ter Brugghen. G. Hoet del. P. Bodart, fec.  Cornelis de Bie, in his Spiegel vande Verdrayde Werelt (1708), and Arnold Houbraken, in his De Groote Schouburgh (1718–1721), produced biographies where they repeated Richard's claims that the painter met Rubens in Rome and also worked in Naples. There was a cadet of the same name serving in the army of Ernst Casimir of Nassau-Dietz in the spring of 1607, and for this reason, Ter Brugghen is thought to have been in Italy, but only in that year, rather than as previously believed in 1604 (inferred as it was from the inscription on the Bodart print). This would certainly mean that he never met Caravaggio in Rome; that artist had fled Rome on a murder charge in 1606. However, it is certain that he was the only Dutch painter in Rome during Caravaggio's lifetime.  By 1614, Ter Brugghen was in Milan, on his way home. On 1 April 1615, Thyman van Galen and Ter Brugghen are witnesses before the court in Utrecht. He is already listed as a member of the Utrecht painter's guild in 1616, and on 15 October of that year he married Jacomijna Verbeeck, his elder brother Jan's stepdaughter.  Ter Brugghen died in Utrecht on 1 November 1629, possibly a victim of the plague. The family had been living in the Snippenvlucht. Ter Brugghen's last child of eight, Hennickgen, was born four months later on 14 March 1630.  He certainly studied Caravaggio's work, as well as that of his followers–the Italian Caravaggisti–such as Orazio Gentileschi. Caravaggio's work had caused quite a sensation in Italy. His paintings were characteristic for their bold tenebroso technique–the contrast produced by clear, bright surfaces alongside sombre, dark sections–but also for the social realism of the subjects, sometimes charming, sometimes shocking or downright vulgar. Other Italian painters who had an influence on Ter Brugghen during his stay in Italy were Annibale Carracci, Domenichino and Guido Reni.  Upon returning to Utrecht, he worked with Gerard van Honthorst, another of the Dutch Caravaggisti. Ter Brugghen's favourite subjects were half-length figures of drinkers or musicians, but he also produced larger-scale religious images and group portraits. He carried with him Caravaggio's influence, and his paintings have a strong dramatic use of light and shadow, as well as emotionally charged subjects. His treatment of religious subjects can be seen reflected in the work of Rembrandt, and elements of his style can also be found in the paintings of Frans Hals and Johannes Vermeer. Peter Paul Rubens described ter Brugghen's work as ""...above that of all the other Utrecht artists"".  Works include:",male,The Hague,Utrecht
Peter Danckerts de Rij,Q304915,"Pieter, Peeter, or Peter Danckerts de Rij, Dankers de Ry, or Peteris Dankersas (1605, in Amsterdam – buried 15 December 1660, Amsterdam). was a Dutch Golden Age painter mostly active in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden.  He was the son of Cornelis Danckerts de Ry, member of a large family of printers, painters and engravers.  Cornelis is mentioned in Houbraken's Schouburg as being one of the many teachers of Joachim von Sandrart in 1640-41, though considering Sandrart's age and experience (he had just returned to the North from his Grand Tour to Italy), this was more of a collaboration. Since Filippo Baldinucci later wrote a biographical sketch on Pietro Danckerse de Ry in his list of artists called the Notizie, it is possible that Danckerts visited Italy at some time. In any case Sandrart engraved some of Peter's paintings after this period. Between 1634 and 1638 he moved to Warsaw, and later Danzig, and Vilnius in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Here he was the court painter and architect of King Władysław IV Vasa. According to Houbraken a poem was written in his honor that applauds his work in Poland.  In 1648 he moved to be a painter at the court of Queen Christina in Stockholm. Her successor, King Charles X Gustav, held him in high regard.  He returned to the Dutch Republic in 1659 and died in Amsterdam in December of the next year.  The story that he died in August 1661 as the result of a highway robbery in the Rūdninkai Forest near Vilnius involves an unnamed artist aged 78, while Danckerts would have been 55. This incident possibly concerns one of Danckerts' successors at the Polish court instead.  In 1634 Peter painted pendant portraits of his parents, his father Cornelis the painter and his mother. His mother's portrait hangs in Johannesburg Art Gallery, and his father's portrait hangs in Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium.

When he was seventeen years old he moved to London, where he was employed by Granville, Earl of Bath, for whom he painted several views and ruins in the west of England. He also painted portraits, but did not meet with much encouragement, although his pictures, particularly his landscapes, possess considerable merit; as a proof of which Horace Walpole states that there were seven pictures by Van Diest in Sir Peter Lely's collection. He etched several landscapes from his own designs, in a slight, masterly style. Van Diest died in London in 1704.

Marie Duchatel,Q18814456,"Marie Duchatel also known as Maria Du Chastel (1652–1692) was a Flemish painter and miniaturist.  She had an international career which brought her to work at the courts of Denmark and East Frisia. She married the Dutch painter Eglon van der Neer and travelled abroad in his company. She is mainly known for her portraits.  Duchatel was born in Brussels where she was baptized on 20 November 1652. She was the daughter of the Flemish painter François Duchatel and Jeanne Louys.  She was trained in painting by her father.  Around 1675 Duchatel visited the Danish court, where she painted the pendant portraits of King Christian V and his wife Charlotte. Around the same time she visited East Frisia. She was given a jewel by Christine Charlotte of Württemberg, a princess consort of George Christian, Prince of East Frisia. She returned to Brussels in 1677 where she likely met her future husband Eglon van der Neer. The couple married around 1680. Their son Johannes van der Neer became a sculptor and was himself the founder of a dynasty of sculptors which flourished in Antwerp until the 19th century.  Between 1689 and 1691, Duchatel accompanied her husband to Düsseldorf, Germany where he was commissioned to portray the princess Maria Anna of Neuburg. She may have assisted him with the portrait. By the end of her time in Germany she was traveling between Düsseldorf and Neuberg acting on matters for the Spanish Crown.  In his biography of her husband, Weyerman mentioned that he lived in an apartment located underneath hers in ""the St. Joseph boarding house in the Keyserstraat in Antwerp"". Duchatel evidently painted daily and lived apart from her husband.  Duchatel is best known for her miniature portraits.

Gerard Edema,Q5549987,"Gerard Edema or Gerard van Edema (c. 1652, Amsterdam – c. 1700, Richmond, Surrey), was a Dutch landscape-painter who settled in England.  Edema is stated to have been a native of Friesland. He was a pupil of Allart van Everdingen, from whom he learnt to paint landscapes of a wild and savage nature, with a predilection for rocks and waterfalls. He came to England about 1670, in his eighteenth year, and shortly afterwards made an expedition to Norway to collect subjects for his pictures.  These travels he extended to Surinam in Dutch Guiana, the West Indies, the English colonies in America, and Newfoundland. He returned to London with a great number of paintings representing the novel and unknown scenery which he had visited, and their strange and awe-inspiring character earned him the name of ‘the Salvator Rosa of the North.’ He had no difficulty in disposing of any number of them to the merchants whose business was connected with those countries, and his landscapes were eagerly sought after by the nobility. Edema, having no talent for figures and buildings, was usually assisted in this line by Jan Wyck.  Sir Richard Edgcumbe, being anxious to have a series of views of Mount-Edgcumbe painted for his house there, employed Edema, Wyck, and Vandevelde to execute them in concert. They remained some time at Mount-Edgcumbe, and produced several views which still exist. Unfortunately for Edema his prosperity led him into luxurious habits and to an inordinate love of the bottle, which caused his death at Richmond about 1700. Two landscapes by him are at Hampton Court. He was a clever painter, but owed his success to the novelty and interest of his subjects. Some authorities distinguish him from a Nicholas Edema, living at the same time, who visited Surinam for the purpose of painting insects and plants, a line of art which he abandoned for landscape-painting. It seems almost certain that there was only one painter of the name.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: ""Edema, Gerard"". Dictionary of National Biography.

He is listed in the 1702 Vincent van der Vinne list as a past and deceased member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke.  The painter Sara van Baalbergen married a Barent van Eysen in 1634 in Haarlem, but it is unclear if he represents the same person or a member of the previous generation.  Barend probably was related to P. van Eijse, thought to be identical to Pieter van Eijsen, who was a painter active in Haarlem in the 1660s.

It is unclear where Joris van der Haagen  was born, either in Arnhem or Dordrecht, but archival evidence shows that he started his drawing career in Arnhem. He probably learned to paint from his father, the painter Abraham van der Haagen. When his father died he moved in 1639 to the Hague, where he joined the Guild of St. Luke in 1643. A year later he became honorary citizen of The Hague. In 1656 he was one of the founding members of the Confrerie Pictura, which was located on the Princessegracht in the Hague. The painting he made of the Princessegracht at this time probably shows the original building, which has since been renovated beyond recognition. He is buried at The Hague.  He is known for his landscapes, and especially his views of various cities in the eastern part of the Netherlands.

According to Houbraken he used blue ash to make the color green, and this had faded by 1715, when he saw his paintings in Amsterdam. Despite this problem, the paintings were sold for high prices.

Gerard Hoet,Q978437,"Gerard Hoet (Dutch: [ˈɣeːrɑrt ˈɦut]; 22 August 1648 – 2 December 1733) was a Dutch Golden Age painter and engraver.  Gerard Hoet trained with his father and brother who were glass painters, and Warnard van Rijsen, who lived in Zaltbommel, and who himself was a pupil of Cornelis van Poelenburgh in Utrecht.  In 1672 Hoet moved to The Hague, but when the Count of Salis bought paintings at his mother's house in Zaltbommel, Hoet returned to paint for him.  Hoet accompanied the Count of Salis to Rees, Germany, where he met the Utrecht painters Jan van Bunnik, Justus Nieuwpoort and Andries de Wit. Hoet returned to Utrecht with De Wit, where he worked for Frederick Nassau de Zuylestein briefly before visiting the Hague and Amsterdam. He then traveled to France on the promise from a Marquis who wanted to give him a commission, but this promise falling through, he made some engravings of paintings by Francisque Millet.  He then wanted to travel to England, but having written to his compatriot Lucas Vorsterman, he received word that there was more work to be had in Paris. Hoet traveled to Paris where he spent more than a year, before returning to the Netherlands via Brussels. In Brussels he met the painter Adriaen Frans Boudewyns, who convinced him to stay a while. After eight months, Hoet returned to Utrecht, where he worked for William Nassau de Zuylestein, 1st Earl of Rochford. He married and settled in Heemstede, where he found work for the lord of the castle there.  Together with the painter Hendrik Schoock, in 1697 he asked the Utrecht city council for permission to found a drawing academy, which was granted. During this period he painted decorations in leading homes of gentlemen in the Utrecht area, most notably the castles of Slangenborg and Voorst near Zutphen, the latter of which he painted for Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle.  In 1715 he returned to The Hague, where he spent the rest of his life.  He had a business as an art dealer in collaboration with the Flemish painter Jacques Ignatius de Roore who resided in The Hague.  He taught his sons Hendrik Jacob and Gerard, as well as Nicolaes van Ravesteyn (II). His son Gerard Hoet II was an amateur painter and art collector who lived on the Lange Voorhout 62.  Hoet was a source for Houbraken, specifically for his list of the Bentvueghels painters. He wrote a set of additions to Johan van Gool's sequel to Houbraken's ""Schouburg"", insisting that Van Gool was incorrect in many of his biographical sketches. Though Van Gool's book was published in 1650, it was probably readily available to Hoet as an ongoing project in 1719 when Houbraken died, which is why there are prints made by Jacob Houbraken to illustrate the first volume.",male,Zaltbommel,The Hague

Gerard van Honthorst,Q314548,"Gerard ""Gerrit"" van Honthorst (4 November 1592 – 27 April 1656) was a Dutch Golden Age painter who became known for his depiction of artificially lit scenes, eventually receiving the Italian nickname Gherardo delle Notti (""Gerard of the Nights""). Early in his career he visited Rome, where he had great success painting in a style influenced by Caravaggio. Following his return to the Netherlands he became a leading portrait painter. Van Honthorst's contemporaries included Utrecht painters Hendrick ter Brugghen and Dirck van Baburen.  Van Honthorst was born in Utrecht, the son of a decorative painter, and trained under his father, and then under Abraham Bloemaert.  Having completed his education, Honthorst went to Italy, where he is first recorded in 1616. He was one of the artists from Utrecht who went to Rome at around this time, all of whom were to be deeply influenced by the recent art they encountered there. They were named the Utrecht caravaggisti. The other three were Dirk van Baburen, Hendrick ter Bruggen and Jan van Bijlert. In Rome he lodged at the palace of Vincenzo Giustiniani, where he painted Christ Before the High Priest, now in London's National Gallery. Giustiniani had an important art collection, and Honthorst was especially influenced by the contemporary artists, including Caravaggio, Bartolomeo Manfredi and the Carracci. He was particularly known for his depiction of artificially lit scenes. Cardinal Scipione Borghese became another important patron, securing important commissions for him at San Silvestro Della Mariro, Montecompatri, and at Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome. He also worked for Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.  Honthorst returned to Utrecht in 1620, and went on to build a considerable reputation both in the Dutch Republic and abroad. In 1623, the year of his marriage, he was president of the Guild of St. Luke in Utrecht. He soon became so fashionable that Sir Dudley Carleton, then English envoy at The Hague, recommended his works to Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel. In 1626 Honthorst hosted a dinner for Peter Paul Rubens, and painted him as the honest man sought for and found by Diogenes.  Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, sister of Charles I of England and Electress Palatine, then in exile in the Netherlands, commissioned Honthorst as a painter and employed him as a drawing-master for her children.[when?] Through her he became known to Charles, who invited him to England in 1628. There he painted several portraits, and a vast allegory, now at Hampton Court Palace, of Charles and his queen Henrietta Maria as Diana and Apollo in the clouds receiving the Duke of Buckingham as Mercury and guardian of the King of Bohemia's children. He painted a more intimate group portrait of The Four Eldest Children of the King of Bohemia, (also at Hampton Court) in which the two eldest are depicted as Diana and Apollo.  After his return to Utrecht, Honthorst retained the patronage of the English monarch, painting for him, in 1631, a large picture of the king and queen of Bohemia and all their children. At around the same time he painted some pictures illustrating the Odyssey for Lord Dorchester, and some showing incidents of Danish history for Christian IV of Denmark. He also painted a portrait of the King's daughter Leonora Christina Ulfeldt while she was in The Hague.  His popularity in the Netherlands was such that he opened a second studio in The Hague, where he painted portraits of members of the court, and taught drawing. These large studios, where the work included making replicas of Honthorst's royal portraits, employed a large number of pupils and assistants; according to one pupil, Joachim von Sandrart, describing his experiences in the mid-1620s, Honthorst would have about 24 students at any one time, each paying 100 guilders a year for their education.  His brother Willem van Honthorst (1594–1666) was also a portrait painter. Many of Willem's paintings were previously misattributed to Gerrit due to the similarity of their signatures. Willem was a pupil of Abraham Bloemaert, and was also taught by his own elder brother. In 1646 he went to Berlin, where he became court painter to Louise-Henriette, wife of the Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg. He returned to Utrecht in 1664.  Honthorst is often referred to as ""Gherardo delle notti"" (""Gerrit of the Nights"") by modern Italians. However, the nickname does not actually appear in any known Italian sources dating before Honthorst's death. Surviving Italian documents from before 1656 refer to the artist as either ""Gherardo Fiammingo"" (""Gerrit the Fleming"") or ""Gherardo Hollandese"" (""Gerrit the Dutchman""), emphasizing his foreignness rather than his trademark skill at rendering nocturnal lighting. It was only in the 18th century that the nickname ""Gherardo delle notti"" came into widespread use.  Honthorst was a prolific artist. His most attractive pieces are those in which he cultivates the style of Caravaggio, often tavern scenes with musicians, gamblers and people eating. He had great skill at chiaroscuro, often painting scenes illuminated by a single candle.  Some of his pieces were portraits of the Duke of Buckingham and his family (Hampton Court), the King and Queen of Bohemia (Hanover and Combe Abbey), Marie de' Medici (Amsterdam Stadthuis), 1628, the Stadtholders and their Wives (Amsterdam and The Hague), Charles Louis and Rupert, Charles I's nephews (Louvre, St Petersburg, Combe Abbey and Willin), and Baron Craven (National Portrait Gallery, London). His early style can be seen in the Lute-player (1614) in the Louvre, the Martyrdom of St John in Santa Maria della Scala at Rome, or the Liberation of Peter in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin.  His 1620 The Adoration of the Shepherds in the Uffizi was destroyed in the Via dei Georgofili Massacre of 1993.  Honthorst's 1623 The Concert was purchased for an undisclosed sum by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., from a private collection in France in November 2013. The painting had not been on view since 1795. The 1.23-by-2.06-metre (4.0 by 6.8 ft) The Concert went on display for the first time in 218 years in a special installation at the National Gallery of Art's West Building on 23 November 2013.

Jan van Huchtenburgh,Q324288,"Jan van Huchtenburg also written as Johan van Huchtenburg (1646 – 1733) was a Dutch painter of equestrian and battle scenes, as well as an engraver of mezzotints, publisher, and art dealer. He is believed to have been a pupil of Thomas Wijck, as he collaborated with Jan Wijck. Much of what is known about his life comes from Arnold Houbraken.  Van Huchtenburg was born in Haarlem, where his father died at an early age. His brother Jacob studied under Nicolaes Pietersz. Berchem and travelled to Rome in 1662. In 1667, Jan himself went to Paris, where he worked at the Manufacture des Gobelins under Charles Le Brun and Adam Frans van der Meulen. His sketches were used for gobelins depicting horses and battle scenes.  In 1670 he returned to Haarlem and married Elisabeth Mommes, daughter of his guardian. By 1681, he had moved to Amsterdam. Huchtenburg assisted Gerrit Berckheyde by painting figures and horses in his cityscapes. In 1683 and 1685 he purchased property, including part of a garden house and a lot at what is now Keizersgracht 611. This appears to have been a case of real estate speculation, as he resold the property a few months later.  In 1709, he entered the service of Prince Eugene of Savoy and accompanied him on campaign. At the prince’s request, Huchtenburg painted ten large battle scenes, some of which remain in the Galleria Sabauda in Turin. He is said to have later reproduced these works on a smaller scale, as they were listed in 1729 among the possessions of broker Johannes Staats.  The series of ten paintings includes depictions of:  Huchtenburg also painted portraits of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who greatly admired his work.  In 1715, he commissioned the widow of Petrus Schenck in Leipzig to sell four of his paintings. In his later years, he lived with his daughter on the Bloemgracht in the Jordaan district of Amsterdam.",male,Haarlem,Amsterdam
Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen,Q636113,"Cornelis Janssens (born Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen,[a] Dutch: [kɔrˈneːlɪ ˈɕɑnsəns fɑŋ ˈkøːlə(n)];[b] bapt. 14 October 1593 – bur. 5 August 1661) was an Anglo-Dutch painter of portraits. Born of Dutch or Flemish parents who fled to London from Antwerp to escape religious persecution, Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen probably trained in the northern Netherlands. Around 1618 he established himself as a portrait painter in London. His signed or monogrammed portraits number several hundred; he is the first English-born painter known to have made so many. He was active in England, from at least 1618 to 1643, when he moved to Middelburg in the Netherlands to escape the English Civil War. Between 1646 and 1652 he lived in Amsterdam, before settling in Utrecht, where he died.  Janssens painted many portraits of emerging new English gentry. His early portraits were panel paintings with ""fictive"" oval frames. His works can be found in major collections in the UK and overseas as well as in private collections in stately homes in Britain.  He was an accomplished portrait painter, but lacked the flair of a master such as Anthony van Dyck. His style varied considerably over his career, and he was able to assimilate new influences into his own style without any discordant effect. He was particularly accurate and detailed in his depiction of clothing. He was one of the few artists in England at this time who consistently signed and dated their work.  Janssens was born to Dutch or Flemish parents in London – his father had been a religious refugee from Antwerp, and his paternal grandfather had come from Cologne. He was baptised at the Dutch Church at Austin Friars much used by the Netherlandish community in London. He was the son of Johanna le Grand and Cornelis Janssens. He may have been trained in the Netherlands, possibly under Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt. He was certainly influenced by other artists from the Netherlands, and his early works follow the design and mood of Dutch painters.  He had returned to England by 1618 when he was a witness at the baptism of his nephew, Theodore Russell – Johnson' sister was married to Nicholas Russell of Bruges. He was active in England, from then until 1643. In the 1620s, he lived and had his studio in Blackfriars, London, as did Anthony van Dyck and Peter Oliver; it was within the boundaries of the City of London, but was a liberty and so avoided the monopoly in the City of members of the London painters' Guild. He married Elizabeth Beke of Colchester on 16 July 1622 at the Dutch church in London. Their son James (who presumably died young) was baptised on 30 September 1623 at St Anne's Church. Another son Cornelis Janssens, junior who also became a painter, was baptised on 15 August 1634.  Janssens wished to be regarded as an English gentleman, registering his pedigree with the College of Arms. His arms were three gold parrots on a gold background, and had a crest of a silver Catherine wheel with two parrot wings behind it. Apparently winged crests are common in German heraldry which may show the arms previously used by the family.  Janssens moved to Canterbury in the mid-1630s, living with Sir Arnold Braems, a Flemish merchant, and continued to live in England until after the outbreak of the English Civil War, but in October 1643, apparently at the insistence of his wife, he moved to Middelburg, joining the Guild of Saint Luke there. He was given parliamentary permission to travel "" ... and to cary with him such pictures and colours, bedding, household stuff, pewter, and brass as belongs to himself"". Between 1646 and 1652 he lived in Amsterdam, before settling in Utrecht, where he was buried.  Janssens' first dated work is from 1617, and may be of a Dutch subject; 1619 marks the beginning of his English portraits, which were initially heads only, although he later painted full-length and group portraits.  For painting a portrait, Janssens liked to charge £5 compared with a more typical figure of 10s – 20s. However, this was not as expensive as better known artists such as van Dyck or Peter Lely. Karen Hearn's ODNB entry for Janssens notes that ""in 1638 Sir Thomas Pelham of Halland House, Sussex, paid £4 for his portrait by Janssens"" (referencing an account book among the Pelham family papers, BL, Add. MS 33145, fol. 107).  There are hundreds of portraits of the emerging new gentry by Janssens, including Lady Rose MacDonnell of Antrim. ""Janssens’ art was best suited to the relative intimacy of the bust length portrait in which, with a certain detachment, he captured the reticence of the English landed gentry and minor aristocracy"". One of his earliest surviving portraits is of Susanna Temple, grandmother of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough (Tate). This portrait was subsequently engraved by Robert White towards the end of the seventeenth century. A copy of the engraving was among the prints owned by Samuel Pepys which subsequently passed to Magdalene College, Cambridge.  His royal portraits include Charles I as well as Charles II and James II, painted as children, both of which are in the National Portrait Gallery, London. He collaborated with Gerard Houckgeest on a portrait of Charles I's wife, Queen Henrietta Maria.  After his move to the Netherlands, he continued to produce portraits of English clients – both exiled Royalists, and clients still living in England.  Janssens’ studio in the 1620s was in St Anne's, Blackfriars, London. The size of Janssens’ studio is not known, but surviving portraits such as the portrait erroneously inscribed Countess of Arundel and that of Sir Alexander Temple (both below) help reconstruct the painting process. It is likely that Janssens did not paint the complete portraits himself. The wet-over-dry paint layering of the costumes (see 'Technique' below) and the fictive ovals allowed contributions from others in the studio, as did the demand for additional versions.  His patrons came from the gentry, but were not from the highest levels in society. His sitters were Dutch immigrants, gentlemen and courtiers. During the first few years of his career, a network of patronage by five families enabled Janssens to establish his reputation as a painter on the national stage. These families were the Boothby family of London and Chingford, the Corbett family of Shropshire, the Leveson family of Shropshire and Staffordshire, the Temple family of Burton Dassett and Stowe, and the Lenthall family of Burford and Besselsleigh. These families were connected to each other by marriage.  The identity of many of his sitters has been lost. Despite having only received a few commissions from the crown, in 1632, Janssens was appointed as ""his Majesty's servant in the quality of Picture drawer"" by Charles I. This appointment was perhaps in connection with the arrival of van Dyck and the departure from England of Daniel Mytens – Janssens may have been found a role as a back-up for van Dyck.  He has been described as ""one of the most gifted and prolific portrait painters practising in England during the 1620s and 1630s"". Lionel Cust describes him as being ""more accomplished"" than Gheeraerts. However, he has also been described as ""a good painter, but unable to compete with the flair and superlative skills of van Dyck"". Compared with van Dyck, Janssens’ portraits were ""lower key but exquisite"".  He was one of the few artists in England at this time who consistently signed and dated their work, except for his later full-lengths, which his clients may have hoped would be mistaken for more expensive van Dycks.  He may have been successful in this, as some full-length portraits attributed to van Dyck's workshop may well be by him.  In the early years, his standard way of signing portraits was the phrase ""fecit C J"", although the 1619 portrait entitled the Countess of Arundel (below) is signed Cornelius Johnson fecit and many later works also have a full signature.  Janssens’ early portraits were panel paintings with ""fictive"" oval frames – they appear to have a wooden or marble oval surround, but this is actually painted on to the panel.  This trompe-l'œil effect was one of Janssens' favourite devices in the early part of his career. ""His figures are usually placed in front of dark, undefined backgrounds with focus on their faces and elaborate costumes that denote their social standing."" He also painted some portrait miniatures on copper.  His early works (for example the 1620 portrait of Sir Alexander Temple) were described by C. H. Collins Baker as ""flat wooden and inanimate"". Within a year, he has made ""an astonishing advance"" and his modelling becomes full and ""his temper established"". His earliest three-quarter length work is a pair of portraits of Thomas Boothby and his wife painted in 1619 and sold by the Weiss Gallery in 1988. Another three-quarter length portrait (of Lord Keeper Coventry) is dated 1623, and shows a certain lack of skill in dealing with the body, which is overcome in later works.  In his portraits, the sitters head is often unexpectedly low. The eyes have enlarged, rounded irises and deep curved upper lids.  The London Painters and Stainers company has a 1623/4 portrait of Clement Pargeter, William Peacock and Thomas Babb that may be by Janssens. If so, it is the earliest group portrait by him.  His style was conservative although it varied considerably over his career, and he was able to assimilate new influences into his own style without any discordant effect. He took from, in turn, Mytens, van Dyck, and William Dobson. His last Dutch portraits show a different style reflecting contemporary portraiture there. However he also influenced other artists – both lesser lights as well as more accomplished artists such as van Dyck. Following the Netherlandish tradition, he was particularly accurate and detailed in depiction of clothing. As a result, his portraits are especially useful to costume historians.  Janssens uses a number of techniques that taken together uniquely identify his studio during his early career. These include the presence of both wet-in-wet and discreet layering; calculated variations in brushwork and the use of high quality (and expensive) pigments that survived aging well.  He ""was masterful in bringing the unique characteristics of his pigments to the most dazzling effect. Janssens’ use of azurite blue is a primary example of how he utilized the character of each pigment to yield distinctive textures and eye-catching details.""  Janssens was consulted by Théodore de Mayerne on handling orpiment (a poisonous yellow pigment) and painted his portrait. In addition to describing his usage of orpiment to de Mayerne, Janssens also told Daniel King his technique for draperies. For linen draperies he used ""white and oker broken with bone black"". For blue draperies, he first laid in ""all the background folds and shadows ... neatly and perfectly finished"" with ""indico ground in drying oiland mixt w[i]th smalt and white"". When this had dried, he painted over it a glaze of ultramarine and ""fair white"".  From the second half of the seventeenth century onwards, there were frequent art auctions in London and later in provincial cities. Johnson's work was regularly sold at these auctions – for example lot 150 at a sale of paintings at Exeter Exchange in the Strand, 3 April 1690.  Karen Hearn, Honorary Professor at University College London, curated a display of Johnson's work which was held at the National Portrait Gallery, London from April to September 2015. In July, 2016, the first large scale exhibition devoted solely to his work was held at the Weiss Gallery in London.  His work can be found in the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, Royal Collection, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the Dulwich Picture Gallery, many UK provincial galleries and in private collections in stately homes in Britain. Outside the UK, his work can be found in the Huntington Library Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, the Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht, the Yale Center for British Art. and Leufsta Manor, Sweden. His Portrait of a Lady was part of the exhibition of Tudor and Stuart Fashion at the Queen's Gallery.  Johnson's name is attached to the Johnson portrait of William Shakespeare in the Folger Shakespeare Library. This was painted around 1610 and has a long association with Shakespeare. It was altered to show a higher forehead. It is no longer believed to be by Johnson.  The large number of variants of his name has led to some controversy over the correct form. Johnson himself must take some responsibility for this since he frequently changed his signature. Hearn has argued that in his later years in the Netherlands, he added the words ""van Ceulen"" (""from Cologne"") to his signature as a marketing technique to emphasize his foreign origins. He had previously added ""Londines"" (London) to his signature, but stopped using this form following the outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652.  Finberg says ""I think I may take this opportunity to protest once again against the prevalent habit of calling this artist Janssens. In spite of Walpole's unfortunate remark that this is the correct form of the name, there is no excuse for using it. While in England the artist invariably spelt his name Cornelius Johnson, and when he left England he changed the form to Jonson. The usual form of his signature when the name is given in full is invariably, in all the pictures painted after 1643 which I have seen : ' Cornelius Jonson van Ceulen.' He appears never to have adopted the form of Janson, Jansen, or Janssens. But so long as auctioneers are born with an ingrained conviction that a foreign-looking name gives greater value to a picture than an English name, so long may we expect to find Cornelius Johnson or Jonson masquerading in catalogues as Cornelius Janssens.""",male,London,Utrecht
Catharina van Knibbergen,Q5052091,"Catharina Knibbergen was a Dutch Golden Age landscape painter.

He is known for Italianate landscapes, sometimes copied from other painters, such as Jan Asselijn.  Ludick married in May 1657 to Cornelia Bosmans/Bosman. They baptized at least 11 children between 1658 and 1677, including two named Lodewijk in 1658 and 1659. Ludick died in Amsterdam, but the year of his death is uncertain. Several sources state that he died ""before 1697"", while persons with his name, both living on the Keizersgracht, are known to be buried in Amsterdam on 27 February 1723 and 22 December 1724.",male,Amsterdam,Amsterdam
Cornelia van Marle,Q3273592,"Cornelia van Marle (1661–1698) was a Dutch Golden Age painter.  She was born in Zwolle as the daughter of the beer brewer Herman van Marle and his wife Lamberta Holt. After her father died her mother married another brewer, Geurt Greve, and he merged his business with Van Marle's at the brewery ""De Gouden Kroon"", located in the Voorstraat (behind the Vrouwenhuis on a street parallel to the Melkmarkt). Their daughter Aleida became Cornelia's half-sister.  Along with her younger half-sister and two cousins, she became a pupil of the Dordrecht painter Wilhelmus Beurs in 1686. Beurs recognized their ability and dedicated his book to them in 1692. All four women made large panels under the instruction of Beurs in 1686, and all four of these hang in the regent's room of the Vrouwenhuis in Zwolle today.",female,Zwolle,Zwolle
Eva van Marle,Q12061493,"Eva van Marle may have been the name of a Dutch Golden Age portrait painter who signed with the monogram E.M., EM.F. (E.M. fecit) and was active in Zwolle, Overijssel, between 1642 and 1654.  According to research by J. Verbeek and J.W. Schotman in 1957, ""monogrammist E.M."" was possibly the teacher of Hendrick ten Oever. The oldest known work with an E.M. signature is a portrait of a goldsmith, who was the brother-in-law of Gerard ter Borch the Elder, dated 1645. Most of the portraits depict people to their waist and all but two depict people from the patriciate and nobility of Overijssel or citizens of Zwolle. Six such portraits hang in the Vrouwenhuis, Zwolle.  Recent scholarship is doubtful about the existence of Eva van Marle. Egbert Berents van Marle, who became a citizen of Zwolle in 1637, is the ancestor of the Zwolle magisterial family Van Marle. Eva would have been of his generation, but there are no genealogical data on her. The first time she is mentioned was in 1875, when the director of the Vrouwenhuis, whose grandfather was a Van Marle, attributed the six portraits there to her. Towards the end of the 20th century, Eva van Marle's existence was enough in doubt that at exhibits the works were again assigned to ""monogrammist EM"". Recent research suggests that the monogram may have been that of the painter Evert Meertman, who was one of six painters listed as members of the Zwolle artisan guild. Evert Meertman may be the same person as the Antwerp painter Ever(ard)t Moerman(s), who married the daughter of a local goldsmith in Zwolle in 1634, and gained citizenship in 1639. He was buried in Zwolle on April 2, 1659.",female,,
Maria Sibylla Merian,Q62530,"Maria Sibylla Merian (2 April 1647 – 13 January 1717) was a German entomologist, naturalist and scientific illustrator. She was one of the earliest European naturalists to document observations about insects directly. Merian was a descendant of the Frankfurt branch of the Swiss Merian family.  Merian received her artistic training from her stepfather, Jacob Marrel, a student of the still life painter Georg Flegel. Merian published her first book of natural illustrations in 1675. She had started to collect insects as an adolescent. At age 13, she raised silkworms. In 1679, Merian published the first volume of a two-volume series on caterpillars; the second volume followed in 1683. Each volume contained 50 plates that she engraved and etched. Merian documented evidence on the process of metamorphosis and the plant hosts of 186 European insect species. Along with the illustrations Merian included descriptions of their life cycles.  In 1699, Merian travelled to Dutch Guiana to study and record the tropical insects native to the region. In 1705, she published Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium. Merian's Metamorphosis has been credited with influencing a range of naturalist illustrators. Because of her careful observations and documentation of the metamorphosis of the butterfly, Merian is considered by David Attenborough to be among the more significant contributors to the field of entomology. She discovered many new facts about insect life through her studies. Until her careful, detailed work, it had been thought that insects were ""born of mud"" by spontaneous generation. Her pioneering research in illustrating and describing the various stages of development, from egg to larva to pupa and finally to adult, dispelled the notion of spontaneous generation and established the idea that insects undergo distinct and predictable life cycles.  Maria Sibylla Merian's father, the Swiss engraver and publisher Matthäus Merian the Elder, married her mother, his second wife, Johanna Sybilla Heyne, in 1646. Maria was born within the next year, making her his ninth child. Her father died in 1650, and in 1651, her mother remarried Jacob Marrel, the flower and still life painter. Marrel encouraged Merian to draw and paint. While he lived mostly in Holland, his pupil Abraham Mignon trained her. At the age of 13, she painted her first images of insects and plants from specimens she had captured. Early on, she had access to many books about natural history. Regarding her youth, in the foreword to Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium, Merian wrote:  I spent my time investigating insects. At the beginning, I started with silkworms in my home town of Frankfurt. I realized that other caterpillars produced beautiful butterflies or moths, and that silkworms did the same. This led me to collect all the caterpillars I could find in order to see how they changed. In May 1665, Merian married Marrel's apprentice, Johann Andreas Graff from Nuremberg; his father was a poet and director of the local high school, one of the leading schools in seventeenth-century Germany. In January 1668, she had her first child, Johanna Helena, and the family moved to Nuremberg in 1670, her husband's home town. While living there, Merian continued painting, working on parchment and linen, and creating designs for embroidery. She also gave drawing lessons to unmarried daughters of wealthy families (her ""Jungferncompaney"", i.e. virgin group), which helped her family financially and increased its social standing. This provided her with access to the finest gardens, maintained by the wealthy and elite, where she could continue collecting and documenting insects. In 1675, Merian was included in Joachim von Sandrart's German Academy. Aside from painting flowers she made copperplate engravings. After attending Sandrart's school she published flower pattern books. In 1678, she gave birth to her second daughter Dorothea Maria.  Other women still-life painters, such as Merian's contemporary Margaretha de Heer, included insects in their floral pictures, but did not breed or study them.: 155  In 1679, she published her first work on insects, the first of a two-volume illustrated book focusing on insect metamorphosis.  In 1678, the family had moved to Frankfurt am Main, but her marriage was an unhappy one. She moved in with her mother after her stepfather died in 1681. In 1683, she traveled to Gottorp and was attracted to the Labadists' community in Holstein. In 1685, Merian travelled with her mother, husband, and children to Friesland where her half-brother Caspar Merian had lived since 1677.  From 1685 onward, Merian, her daughters, and her mother lived with the Labadist community, which had settled on the grounds of a stately home – Walt(h)a Castle – at Wieuwerd in Friesland. They stayed there for three years and Merian found the time to study natural history and Latin, the language in which scientific books were written at the time. In the moors of Friesland, she observed the birth and development of frogs, and collected them to dissect them.: 163  Merian stayed with the community until 1691.  In Wieuwerd, the Labadists engaged in printing and many other occupations, including farming and milling. At its peak, the religious community numbered around 600, with many more adherents further afield. Visitors came from England, Italy, Poland, and elsewhere, but not all approved of the strict discipline, religious separatism, and community property. Merian's husband was refused by the Labadists, but came back twice.  In 1690, Merian's mother had died. A year later, she moved with her daughters to Amsterdam. In 1692, her husband divorced her. In Amsterdam the same year, her daughter Johanna married Jakob Hendrik Herolt, a successful merchant in the Suriname trade, originally from Bacharach. The flower painter Rachel Ruysch became Merian's pupil. Merian made a living selling her paintings. She and her daughter Johanna sold flower pictures to art collector Agnes Block. By 1698 Merian lived in a well-furnished house on Kerkstraat.: 166   In 1699, the city of Amsterdam granted Merian permission to travel to Suriname in South America, along with her younger daughter Dorothea Maria. On 10 July, the fifty-two year old Merian and her daughter set sail. The goal of the mission was to spend five years illustrating new species of insects. In order to finance the mission, Maria Sibylla sold 255 of her own paintings. She would later write:  In Holland, with much astonishment what beautiful animals came from the East and West Indies. I was blessed with having been able to look at both the expensive collection of Doctor Nicolaes Witsen, mayor of Amsterdam and director of the East Indies society, and that of Mr. Jonas Witsen, secretary of Amsterdam. Moreover, I also saw the collections of Mr. Fredericus Ruysch, doctor of medicine and professor of anatomy and botany, Mr. Livinus Vincent, and many other people. In these collections I had found innumerable other insects, but found that their origin and their reproduction is unknown, it begs the question as to how they transform, starting from caterpillars and chrysalises and so on. All this has, at the same time, led me to undertake a long-dreamed-of journey to Suriname. Merian arrived on 18 September or 19 September in Suriname, and met with the governor Paulus van der Veen. She worked for two years, travelling throughout the colony and sketching local animals and plants. She recorded local native names for the plants and described local uses.  Unlike other Dutch naturalists, Merian was not employed by a commercial enterprise or corporation. The preface of her Suriname book does not acknowledge any patrons or sponsors of her trip. Some believe her journey may have been financed by the directors of the Dutch West India Company.: 211  In her subsequent publication on the expedition Merian criticised the actions of the colonial merchants, saying that ""the people there have no desire to investigate anything like that; indeed they mocked me for seeking anything other than sugar in the country."" Merian also condemned the merchants' treatment of slaves. An enslaved person was forced to assist Merian in her research, and the labor of this person enabled interactions she had with the Amerindian and African slaves in the colony who assisted her in researching the plants and animals of Suriname. Merian also took an interest in agriculture and lamented the colonial merchants' resistance to plant or export anything other than sugar. She later showcased the vegetables and fruits that could be found in Suriname, including the pineapple.: 212–213   In June 1701 an illness, possibly malaria, forced her to return to the Dutch Republic. Back in the Netherlands Merian opened a shop. She sold specimens she had collected and her engravings of plant and animal life in Suriname. In 1705, she published a book Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium about the insects of Suriname.  In 1715, Merian suffered a stroke. Despite being partially paralysed, she continued her work. She died in Amsterdam on 13 January 1717 and was buried four days later at Leidse kerkhof. Although she is sometimes described as dying impoverished, her funeral was a middle-class one with fourteen pall-bearers. Her daughter Dorothea published Erucarum Ortus Alimentum et Paradoxa Metamorphosis, a collection of her mother's work, after Merian's death.  Merian first made a name for herself as a botanical artist. In 1675, she started to publish a three-volume series, each with twelve plates depicting flowers.: 35  In 1680 she published Neues Blumenbuch, combining the series.: 142   The drawings were decorative and not all were drawn based on observation. Some of the flowers in the three-volume series appear to be based on drawings by Nicolas Robert and her stepfather Jacob Marrel. Merian included insects among the flowers; again she may not have observed them all herself, and some may be copies of drawings by Jacob Hoefnagel.: 35  The single flowers, wreaths, nosegays and bouquets in the three volumes would provide patterns for artists and embroiderers.: 146  Embroidery was at the time an essential part of the education that privileged young women received in Europe. Copying from other artists was an essential part of an artist's training at the time.: 143  Her compositions resemble the compartment style of the scrolling stem embroidery designs that were common in Europe at the time. Butterflies and damselflies interplayed with plants, reflecting the decorative compositions of Hoefnagel.: 150  Her subsequent Raupen books would also be used as patterns for paintings, drawings and sewing.: 158   Merian also sold hand-coloured editions of the Blumenbuch series.: 152  Merian's process of creating her art used vellum which she primed with a white coat. Because of the guild system women were not allowed to paint in oil. Merian painted with watercolours and gouache instead.  Merian was one of the early naturalists to observe insects directly. Merian collected and observed live insects and created detailed drawings. In her time insects still had a reputation as ""beasts of the devil"" and the process of metamorphosis was largely unknown. While a handful of scholars had published empirical information on the insect, moth and butterfly life cycle, the widespread contemporary belief was that they were ""born of mud"" by spontaneous generation. Merian documented evidence to the contrary and described the life cycles of 186 insect species.  Merian had started to collect insects as an adolescent and kept a study journal. Aged 13, she raised silkworms and other insects. Her interest turned to moths and butterflies, which she collected and studied. While living in Nuremberg and Frankfurt Merian would travel to the surrounding countryside to search for caterpillar larvae. She recorded their food plants, the timing of their metamorphoses, and noted the behaviour she observed.: 36  It was not unusual for naturalists to illustrate their own research, but Merian was among the early professionally trained artists to illustrate her lifelong studies and observations.  She observed the life cycles of insects over decades, making detailed drawings based on live insects in their natural environment or freshly preserved specimens. This set her apart from previous artist-naturalists such as Conrad Gesner. Her drawings and engraved plates depict moths laying eggs, or caterpillars feeding on leaves. By drawing live insects Merian could accurately depict colours, which were lost from preserved specimens. The plates she eventually published are complex compositions, based on detailed studies of individual insects she painted on vellum; many are preserved in her study journal. A comparison shows that she changed little and preserved the posture and colour of insects when placing them into the larger composition of her plates. In the course of her insect studies she also recorded and painted the reproductive cycle of flowers, from bud through fruit. As a trained artist Merian was concerned with colour accuracy and in Metamorphosis she recorded the plants from which pigments could be derived. The engravings she produced or supervised are little different from her original watercolours. She also hand-coloured some engravings.: 37   In 1679, Merian published the first volume of a two-volume series on caterpillars, with a second volume in 1683. Each volume contained 50 plates engraved and etched by Merian, with a description of the insects, moths, butterflies and their larvae she had observed. Der Raupen wunderbare Verwandlung und sonderbare Blumennahrung – The Caterpillars' Marvellous Transformation and Strange Floral Food, was very popular in certain segments of high society as it was written in the vernacular, but her work was largely ignored by scientists of the time.: 36   The title page of her 1679 Caterpillars proudly proclaimed in German:   ""wherein by means of an entirely new invention the origin, food and development of caterpillars, worms, butterflies, moths, flies and other such little animals, including times, places and characteristics, for naturalists, artists, and gardeners, are diligently examined, briefly described, painted from nature, engraved in copper and published independently."": 39  Jan Goedart had described and depicted the life stages of European moths and butterflies before her, but Merian's ""invention"" was the detailed study of species, their life-cycle and habitat. Goedart had documented species by depicting one adult, a pupa and one larva. Merian depicted the physical differences between male and female adults, showed wings in different positions and the different colouring on each side of the wing. She also documented the extended proboscis of feeding insects. The first plate in her 1679 Caterpillars detailed the life cycle of the silkworm moth. Starting in the right-hand corner with eggs, progressing with a hatching larva and several moults of the growing larva.: 39  Goedart had not included eggs in his images of the life stages of European moths and butterflies, because he had believed that caterpillars were generated from water. When Merian published her study of insects, it was widely believed that insects were spontaneously generated. Merian's discoveries were made independently of, and supported, the findings of Francesco Redi, Marcello Malpighi and Jan Swammerdam.: 40   While Merian's depiction of insects' life cycle was innovative in its accuracy, it was her observations on the interaction of organisms that are now regarded as a major contribution to the modern science of ecology. The depiction of insects and their plant hosts set Merian's work apart from that of the classic by Swammerdam and Francis Willughby as well as the work of her countrymen and contemporaries such as Georg Rumphius.: 40  Merian was the first to show that each stage of the change from caterpillar to butterfly depended on a small number of plants for its nourishment. She noted that as a consequence the eggs were laid near these plants. In her description she commented on the environmental factors that influenced the growth of insects. On caterpillars she noted that the size of their larvae increased by the day if they had enough food. ""Some then attain their full size in several weeks; others can require up to two months."": 39   Among her more significant contribution to science is the pairing of each larval lepidopteran, which she observed with a plant on which it feeds. She collected and kept caterpillars and conducted experiments to confirm her observations. She noted ""caterpillars which fed on one flowering plant only, would feed on that one alone, and soon died if I did not provide it for them."" She documented that some caterpillars would feed on more than one plant, but some only did so if they were deprived of their preferred host plant.: 41   Merian in her detailed studies made several other unique observations. In relation to larvae, she recorded that ""many shed their skins completely three or four times"". She illustrated this with a drawing showing a shed exoskeleton.: 39  She also detailed the ways in which larvae formed their cocoons, the possible effects of climate on their metamorphosis and numbers, their mode of locomotion, and the fact that when caterpillars ""have no food, they devour each other"". Such information was recorded by Merian for specific species.: 41   In 1699, Merian travelled to Dutch Surinam to study and record the tropical insects.: 36  The pursuit of her work in Suriname was an unusual endeavour, especially for a woman. In general, only men received royal or government funding to travel in the colonies to find new species of plants and animals, make collections and work there, or settle. Scientific expeditions at this period of time were not common, and Merian's self-funded expedition raised many eyebrows. She succeeded, however, in discovering a whole range of previously unknown animals and plants in the interior of Suriname. Merian spent time studying and classifying her findings and described them in great detail. She not only described the insects she found, but also noted their habitat, habits and uses to indigenous people. Her classification of butterflies and moths is still relevant today. She used Native American names to refer to the plants, which became used in Europe:  I created the first classification for all the insects which had chrysalises, the daytime butterflies and the nighttime moths. The second classification is that of the maggots, worms, flies, and bees. I retained the indigenous names of the plants, because they were still in use in America by both the locals and the Indians.  Merian's drawings of plants, frogs, snakes, spiders, iguanas, and tropical beetles are still collected today by amateurs all over the world. The German word Vogelspinne – (a spider of the infraorder Mygalomorphae), translated literally as bird spider – probably has its origins in an engraving by Merian. The engraving, created from sketches drawn in Suriname, shows a large spider who had just captured a bird. In the same engraving and accompanying text Merian was the first European to describe both army ants and leaf cutter ants as well as their effect on other organisms. Merian's depictions of tropical ants were subsequently cited and copied by other artists. Her depictions of the struggle among organisms predate Charles Darwin and Lord Tennyson's theories on the struggle for survival and evolution.: 42   In 1705, three years after returning from her expedition, she published Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium.: 36  Metamorphosis first was published at her own expense.: 43  Merian had returned from Suriname with sketches and notes. As the word spread among scholars in Amsterdam, visitors came to view her paintings of exotic insects and plants. She noted ""Now that I had returned to Holland and several nature-lovers had seen my drawings, they pressured me eagerly to have them printed. They were of the opinion that this was the first and most unusual work ever painted in America."" With the assistance of her daughters Johanna and Dorothea, Merian put together a series of plates. She did not make the printing plates herself this time, but hired three printmakers to do the engraving. She supervised the work closely. To pay for this work she advertised for subscribers, who were willing to give her money in advance for a hand-painted deluxe edition of the Metamorphosis. Twelve subscribers paid in advance to receive the expensive hand-painted edition, while a less expensive printed edition in black and white was also published.: 71  After her death the book was reprinted in 1719, 1726 and 1730, finding a larger audience.: 43  It was published in German, Dutch, Latin and French.: 48  Merian contemplated publishing the book in English, with the intention of presenting it to Queen Anne. She mused, ""It is reasonable for a woman to make such a gift to a person of the same sex"". However, nothing came of the plan.: 76   Metamorphosis and the tropical ants Merian documented were cited by the scientists René Antoine, August Johann Rösel von Rosenhof, Mark Catesby and George Edwards. Merian's Metamorphosis has been credited with influencing a range of naturalist illustrators.: 44, 45, 46 & 47  Merian also documented the medicinal use of plants and animals by the people of Suriname. She documented among others that the sap from a palm was used rubbed into itchy scalps to treat worm infections.: 76  Merian also took an interest in agriculture and among the local fruit she showcased was the pineapple.: 212–213  When describing the pineapple Merian cited several standard works on natural history, which first had documented the fruit, such as Historia Naturalis Brasilae by Willem Piso and Georg Marggraf, Hortus Malabaricus by Hendrik van Rheede, and Medici Amstelodamensis by Caspar Commelin. While the pineapple had been drawn before, Merian's became the most prominent.: 217  She provided information on how the butterflies and cockroaches affected crops and agriculture in the colony.: 218  While documenting the botany of Suriname, Merian continued to record the metamorphosis of insects. Suriname's insects were shown throughout their entire life cycle and on their plant host.: 216   A significant number of Merian's paintings combining a plant, caterpillar and butterfly are simply decorative, and make no attempt to describe the life cycle. For instance, the Gulf fritillary is shown with a vanilla plant, an orchid from the Americas, which is definitely not the host plant, and with the caterpillar of some other species. This problem recurs in many of her illustrations. An attempt to identify the insects and plants in a recent facsimile edition of her Suriname book was able to determine a number of species, although Merian usually gets the food plants wrong, makes numerous mistakes in depicting the morphology, and usually pairs the wrong species of caterpillar with its imago. Her drawings are part of the scientific exploration by Europeans. Early taxonomy of tropical plants relied on images or specimens. Following her return to Amsterdam the images she had made were used by Carl Linnaeus and others to identify one hundred or so new species.: 38  At the time there was no standardised scientific terminology to name plants and animals, so Merian used common everyday European words to describe Surinam's animals, such as silkworm or wasp. As such, she referred to butterflies as ""summer birds"". Linnaeus used Merian's drawings to describe 56 animals and 39 plants from Suriname, including the tarantula, in 1735 and 1753. In reference to her research, Linnaeus abbreviated her name into Mer.surin. for animals from Surinam, and Mer.eur. for European insects.: 86   Merian was the first European woman to independently go on a scientific expedition in South America. In the 19th century Ida Pfeiffer, Alexine Tinne, Florence Baker, Mary French Sheldon, Mary Henrietta Kingsley and Marianne North followed in her footsteps and explored the natural world of Africa. Margaret Fountaine studied butterflies on five continents. Merian's scientific expedition of Surinam predated Alexander von Humboldt's famous South America expedition by 100 years, and that of Princess Theresa of Bavaria by 200 years. Merian's publication on her expedition was later identified as a key exponent of illustrated geographical publications originating in Holland in the late 17th century, which marketed an exotic but accessible New World to Europeans.: 167   When Merian moved to Amsterdam in 1691, she made the acquaintance of several naturalists.: 36  Amsterdam was the centre of the Dutch Golden Age and a nexus for science, art and trade.: 9  When settling in, Merian found support from the artist Michiel van Musscher, who lived not far away.: 166  She took in students, one being Rachel Ruysch, daughter of the anatomist and physician Frederick Ruysch.: 312  Merian became an important figure among Amsterdam's botanists, scientists and collectors.: 141  Her Caterpillars books were getting noticed among the scientific community in England, she continued to breed caterpillars at home and ventured into the country side surrounding Amsterdam to study ants. Among her friends were the director of the Amsterdam Botanical Garden Caspar Commelin, the mayor of Amsterdam and president of the Dutch East India Company Nicolaes Witsen, the professor of medicine Fredericus Ruysch, and the merchant and collector Levinus Vincent.: 208   Trading ships brought back never seen before shells, plants and preserved animals.: 9  But Merian was not interested in preserving, collecting, or studying specimens. When she received a specimen from the London apothecary James Petiver she wrote to him that she was interested in ""the formation, propagation, and metamorphosis of creatures, how one emerges from the other, and the nature of their diet."": 38  Nevertheless, Merian accepted contract work. She helped to illustrate the book The Amboinese Curiosity Cabinet written by Georg Eberhard Rumpf. Rumpf was a naturalist and in the course of his work for the Dutch East India Company had collected Indonesian shells, rocks, fossils and sea animals. Merian, and possibly her daughter Dorothea, helped to compile illustrations of the specimens for the book, as Rumpf went blind from glaucoma and continued work on the book with assistants until 1690. It was published in 1705.: 77   The exotic specimens on display in Amsterdam may have inspired her to travel to Surinam, but only interrupted her study of European insects briefly. Merian continued her collection and observation activities, adding plates to her Caterpillars books and updating the existing plates. She republished the two volumes in Dutch in 1713 and 1714 under the title Der Rupsen.: 36  She extended her studies into flies and rewrote the preface to her books to eradicate any mention of spontaneous generation. She explained that flies emerged from a caterpillar pupa, and suggested that flies could thereby be born from excrement.: 222  The 50 plates and descriptions of European insects that appear to have been intended for a third volume were published after her death by her daughters, who combined them with the 1713 editions to one large volume. A number of Metamorphosis editions were also published posthumously by her family, to which 12 additional plates were added. All but two appear to have been Merian's work.: 36   Merian was described as lively, hard working and courteous by a visiting scholar in 1711. Her house was full of drawings, insects, plants, fruit, and on the walls were her Surinam watercolours.: 79  Shortly before Merian's death, her work was seen in Amsterdam by Peter the Great. After her death in 1717, he acquired a significant number of her paintings, which to this day are kept in academic collections in Saint Petersburg.  Several scholars have traced mistakes that were falsely attributed to Merian after her death. One example revolves around who added color to first edition plates of her Surinam book. Some first editions included plates that were painted by Merian and others had colorless plates. People later colored in the black and white plates without following the color palette used by Merian, similar to the concept of coloring books, and some suspect these later colors made it to the second edition. In another example, the printer of the 1730 edition of Surinam added plates using fictitious images of caterpillar life cycles that Merian did not originally include in the book and used for different, unscientific, purposes. Critics later cited these plates as proof to discredit Merian.  Long after her death a number of taxa, and two genera, were named after her. Three butterflies have been named after her, in 1905 a form of a split-banded owlet butterfly Opsiphanes cassina merianae; in 1967 a subspecies of the common postman butterfly Heliconius melpomene meriana; and in 2018 a rare butterfly Catasticta sibyllae from Panamá.  The Cuban sphinx moth has been named Erinnyis merianae. A Tessaratomidae bug has been named Plisthenes merianae. A genus of mantises has been named Sibylla.: 88  Also the orchid bee Eulaema meriana.  The bird-eating spider Avicularia merianae was named in her honour, referencing her research on spiders. The spider Metellina merianae was named after her in 2017. An Argentine tegu lizard has been named Salvator merianae. A toad was named Rhinella merianae. A snail was named Coquandiella meriana. The Madagascan population of the African stonechat bird was given the name Saxicola torquatus sibilla.: 88   A genus of flowering plants was named Meriania. An iris-like plant was given the name Watsonia meriana.: 88   Merian is considered a saint by the God's Gardeners, a fictional religious sect that is the focus of Margaret Atwood's 2009 novel The Year of the Flood.  In the last quarter of the twentieth century, the work of Merian was re-evaluated, validated, and reprinted. Her portrait was printed on the 500 DM note before Germany converted to the euro. Her portrait has also appeared on a 0.40 DM stamp, released on 17 September 1987, and many schools are named after her. In the late 1980s the Archiv imprint of the Polydor label issued a series of new recordings of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's piano works performed on period instruments, and featuring Merian's floral illustrations. She was honoured with a Google Doodle on 2 April 2013 to mark her 366th birth anniversary.  The renewed scientific and artistic interest in her work was triggered in part by a number of scholars who examined collections of her works, such as the one in Rosenborg Castle, Copenhagen. In 2005, a modern research vessel named RV Maria S. Merian was launched at Warnemünde, Germany. In 2016, Merian's Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium was re-published with updated scientific descriptions and, in June 2017, a symposium was held in her honour in Amsterdam. In March 2017, the Lloyd Library and Museum in Cincinnati, Ohio hosted ""Off the Page"", an exhibition rendering many of Merian's illustrations as 3D sculptures with preserved insects, plants, and taxidermy specimens.  The Argentine black and white tegu (Salvator merianae), a type of large lizard, was named in honour of Merian after its discovery and classification.  In 2021-2022 Merian’s work was featured in the exhibition, Women Artists and Patrons in the Natural Sciences, 1650–1800, at the Morgan Library & Museum.  In 2024, the Rijksmuseum acquired one of 67 known surviving first editions of Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium.  Today, while Merian has experienced reinvigorated fame in the eyes of the art and science communities, some of her work has now been re-attributed to her daughters Johanna and Dorothea; Sam Segal has re-attributed 30 of 91 folios in the British Museum.",female,Frankfurt,Amsterdam
Abraham Mignon,Q330400,"Abraham Mignon or Minjon  (21 June 1640 – 27 March 1679) was a Dutch still life painter.  He is known for his flower pieces, still lifes with fruit, still lifes in forests or grottoes, still lifes of game and fish as well as his garland paintings. His works are influenced by those of Jan Davidszoon de Heem and Jacob Marrel.  After commencing his artistic training in his native Germany, he moved to the Dutch Republic where he was active in Utrecht during the last part of his short life.  His works were sought after by 17th and 18th-century collectors from the highest ranks of society throughout Europe.  Mignon was born in Frankfurt where he was baptized in the Calvinist church on 21 June 1640.  His family was originally from Hainaut in the Southern Netherlands from where it had immigrated to Germany for religious reasons.  In Frankfurt they owned a shop.  When Abraham's family moved to Wetzlar in 1649, Abraham was placed in the care of Jacob Marrel, a specialist flower painter and art dealer.  Marrel gave the young boy also artistic training.  He clearly trusted Mignon to handle his business, as he would leave it in Mignon's hands during his frequent visits to the Dutch Republic and in particular, Utrecht. It was also Marrell who asked Mignon to train his live-in stepdaughter Maria Sibylla Merian (1647–1717) in the art of still-life painting. Maria Sibylla Merian was the daughter of the engraver Matthew Merian (1647–1717).  Maria Sibylla Merian achieved distinction as a flower painter.  It is possible that in 1660 Mignon had moved to Wetzlar where the rest of his family had moved. Other sources state that by 1659 Marrell and Mignon had left Frankfurt for Utrecht. It is possible that the death of Mignon's father around this time prompted the relocation to Utrecht.  In 1669 Marrel and Mignon were both registered in the Guild of Saint Luke there. Mignon was an assistant in the workshop of Jan Davidszoon de Heem in Utrecht. Jan Davidszoon de Heem was an important innovator of still life painting who had worked for many years in Antwerp before returning to Utrecht in 1667.  It is possible that after de Heem moved back to Antwerp in 1672 Mignon took over de Heem's workshop.  Throughout his life Mignon seems to have held on to the strict religious beliefs of his family. This is confirmed by his election in 1672 to the position of deacon of the Waalse Kerk (Walloon Church) of Utrecht, a position he remained in for five years. He married Maria Willaerts on 3 February 1675 in the French reformed Janskerk in Utrecht.  His wife was the granddaughter of the marine painter Adam Willaerts, daughter of the painter Cornelis Willaerts and niece of the fish still life painter Jacob Gillig.  Some sources state that Mignon moved back to his native Frankfurt in 1676 based on a record that seems to imply that his 6th child was baptized in Frankfurt on 17 December 1676.  By 1677 he would then have moved back to Utrecht.  Mignon died in Utrecht at the age of 39. He left two daughters when he died, Catharina and Anna.  Besides Maria Sibylla Merian, another known pupil of Mignon was Ernst Stuven.  Mignon was a specialist still life painter whose subjects ranged from flowers, fruit, forest still lifes, game pieces, garland paintings, fish still lifes and insect pieces. His best-known works are his elaborate compositions of flowers and fruits arranged in niches or on stone ledges, or displayed in grottos or amidst ruins.  As Mignon never dated his compositions it has been notoriously difficult to establish a chronology for his work. On stylistic grounds it is assumed that his more elaborate still lifes of flowers, characterised by clear colours, sharp focus and the use of a dark background, are Mignon's distillation of de Heem's style.  Such works likely date from the years around 1670 when he was working closely with his master in de Heem's workshop.  The majority of Mignon's works take the portrait format and only a few are in landscape format.  As Mignon died at a relatively young age, it is reasonable to assume that the circa 400 still-life paintings attributed to him were executed with the assistance of his workshop or by followers of his style. His large output demonstrates the popularity of his works, which were collected widely in the 17th and 18h centuries, including by king Louis XIV of France and the Elector of Saxony.  Mignon's success also attracted followers and imitators such as Jan Mortel, Conraet Roepel and Jacob Bart.  The principal influences on his work are the works of de Heem and Marrel. De Heem's compositions were the principal reference point for Mignon's still lifes.  His work is distinguished from de Heem by his rendering of nature in a cooler, more distant and sterile manner, through the precision in detail and drawing. His flower pieces are marked by their careful finish and delicate handling. Mignon preferred a red, yellow and blue color palette and highly realistic manner of depicting nature.  His favourite scheme was to introduce red or white roses in the centre of the canvas and to set the whole group of flowers against a dark background.  Mignon also took inspiration from Willem van Aelst and Otto Marseus van Schrieck in his game and insect pieces.  Willem van Aelst was clearly an inspiration for the game pieces while the influence of Otto Marseus van Schrieck is particularly visible in Mignon's forest floor still lifes.  As can be expected in still life paintings from the 17th century, religious symbolism is often present in the works of Mignon, an artist who was deeply religious. Such symbolism is clearly present in the Still life with peonies, roses, parrot tulips, morning glory, an iris and poppies in a glass vase set within a stone niche and caterpillars, a snail, a bee and a cockchafer on the ledge below (Sotheby's London sale of 4 July 2007 lot 41) in which various religious themes are expressed symbolically.  God's creation is symbolised through the four elements which at the time were believed to be the building blocks for everything existing in the visible world: earth is symbolised by its products (flowers, insects, stone), air by the flying insects, fire by the glass vase (which is made by fire) and water is present through the water inside the vase. The ears of corn are usually a reference to the Resurrection of Jesus as well as to the cycle of life. This theme is further expressed by the presence of caterpillars, an insect which turns into butterflies.  The motif of Vanitas or transience of life is also often present.  This motif is inspired by the Christian belief that the world is only a temporary place of fleeting pleasures and sorrows from which mankind can only escape through the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus.  Mignon often represents the theme of transience through the poppies in his still lifes.  For example, in the Still life with peonies, roses, parrot tulips, morning glory, an iris and poppies in a glass vase set within a stone niche and caterpillars, a snail, a bee and a cockchafer on the ledge below, the poppy in the centre is fresh, the one at the top is mature while the one hanging over the ledge is already wilting.  Vanitas symbolism can also be found in the Still life with fruits, foliage and insects (Minneapolis Institute of Art). The fruit in the composition looks nice on first view but on closer inspection, it is clear it has already started to rot. The strong oak tree shows signs of blight. A stone in the foreground refers to the inevitable decay of buildings erected by humans, a theme that is reprised in the crumbling arch in the background on the right.  In the Still life with flowers and a watch (Rijksmuseum) the inclusion of a watch and wilting flowers clearly emphasizes the vanitas symbolism of time destroying everything.  Abraham Mignon painted a few pronkstillevens, the sumptuous still lifes that were popular in Flanders and the Dutch Republic from the 1640s.  His work in this genre was influenced by Jan Davidsz. de Heem who played an important role in developing the genre during his residence in Antwerp.  A representative example in this genre is the Still life with fruit and oysters (Rijksmuseum).  Mignon's stylistic and thematic development bears witness to the blurring of boundaries between the distinctive specialties in still life painting such as vanitas pieces, game pieces, pronkstilllevens, etc. that started in the middle of the 17th century. This blurring allowed artists to experiment with the mixing of genres. An example is Mignon's Still life of game in a forest (Louvre, 1675) in which the traditional elements of a still life are transposed to a forest. The result is a mixing of earlier genre categories and conventions. The use of a forest floor as the setting for a still life piece was not entirely new as Otto Marseus van Schrieck had already introduced it.  In 1938, the Nazi Gestapo seized Mignon's Blumenstück from the Jewish art collector Rudolf Guttmann in Vienna. Agents of Hitler's Fuhrermuseum acquired Blumenstück at the Dorotheum on October 10, 1943. The Monuments Men recovered it and moved to it the Central Collecting Point until 1951. It was sold at Christies Mauerbach Benefit Auction in October 1996.  The German Lost Art Foundation currently lists seven artworks by Mignon, of which two have been the object of ""amicable settlement"".  The Max Stern Art Restitution Project also lists a Mignon among the stolen artworks it is actively looking for.",male,Frankfurt,Utrecht
Hendrik Munnichhoven,Q2790773,"Hendrick Munnichhoven (or Hendrik Munnikhoven, Münnichhoven, Munnichhoven, Munnekus, Munnikus, Monnickes), probably born in Utrecht, (died August 1664, Stockholm) was a Dutch painter. He became a master in the Utrecht Guild of Saint Luke in 1627 or 1633 and its dean in 1643. The same year he moved to The Hague as court painter of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. He was hired in 1650 by Queen Christina of Sweden and was commissioned to paint several portraits. Munnikhoven was mainly active as a copyist of other artists' works; one of his copies of David Beck's painting of Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie is on display at Gripsholm Castle.  In 1648 he joined the service of Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie in Prague; he accompanied De la Gardie to Leipzig, Riga and Stockholm during the next years. He performed several portraits of De la Gardie and his relatives. When Queen Christina abdicated in 1654 he moved to Charles X Gustav of Sweden's services and portraited in the following years the King and Queen Hedvig Eleonora.  In 1660 he moved to Riga, but his stay there was short-lived and he returned to Stockholm, where he died in 1664. His older sister Barbara Swever took over his paint shop.  Of his Swedish production, he performed including three major paintings for De la Gardie, a painting of Hercules, Venus and Cupid, Venus with a full-length and one with Mars on a drum. Although these works have been lost, there are a number of surviving portraits of Munnichhoven own as well as copies of others' works. His works include the large double portrait of De la Gardie and Countess Palatine Maria Eufrosyne of Zweibrücken, as well as that of Beata Elisabet von Königsmarck.",male,Utrecht,Stockholm
Maria van Oosterwijck,Q292250,"Maria van Oosterwijck (1630–1693), also spelled Oosterwyck, was a Dutch Golden Age painter, specialising in richly detailed flower paintings and other still lifes.  Maria van Oosterwijck was born in 1630 in Nootdorp, a town located near Delft in South Holland, the Netherlands. Her date of birth is generally listed as 20 August, but some sources state that it was 27 August. Her father was a Dutch Reformed Church minister, as was her grandfather. When she was quite young, her father took her to the studio of the masterful still life painter Jan Davidsz. de Heem. Under de Heem's influence, van Oosterwijck developed her interest in floral painting. She became his student, and showed herself to have a talent for vividly painting realistic creations.  Van Oosterwijck initially worked in Delft and later moved to Utrecht. She worked with de Heem, and years later she produced her first professional piece which had been created independently. When de Heem moved to Antwerp, van Oosterwijck had ample opportunity for independent painting.  Sometime in the early to mid-1670s, she moved to Amsterdam, where her studio was opposite the workshop of fellow flower painter Willem van Aelst. Van Aelst courted her, but she refused his hand, and he reportedly stopped pursuing her because her devotion to painting was more important to her. Van Oosterwijck remained single throughout her life, but raised her nephew, who had been orphaned.  In addition to being a talented painter, she was also a successful businesswoman; she obtained the services of an agent in Amsterdam to market her pieces to Germans. Among her patrons were Louis XIV of France, the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, Augustus II the Strong, and William III of England. She sold three pieces to the King of Poland. Despite the fact that her skillfully executed paintings of flowers were sought out by Dutch and other collectors, she was denied membership in the painters' guild, because women were not allowed to join.  Very few women were professional artists during the 1600s. In a 2004 book on Dutch Golden Age paintings by art historian Christopher Lloyd, van Oosterwijck was the only woman whose work was included. Early writers tended to depict female artists by correlating virtues which were traditionally held by women with similar values gleaned from interpretation of their paintings. Van Oosterwijck, who devoted her life to her painting rather than being a wife and mother, proved a challenging subject for these writers, and their accounts may not portray her as a fully formed personality. The more personal aspects of her paintings were also largely unexplored. This is in contrast to Rachel Ruysch (1664–1750), who was married and had ten children, and was written about in very personable and glowing terms.  As an homage to van Oosterwijck's skill as a floral painter – considered an acceptable vocation for a woman of the time – Wallerant Vaillant painted a portrait of her holding a palette. This 1671 portrait, held in Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum, shows her holding a Bible in her other hand. Another portrait of her, attributed to Gerard de Lairesse, features her posing with poet Dirk Schelte. In 1673, Schelte had written a poem in tribute to the beauty of van Oosterwijck's paintings, as well as that of her character. The portrait appears to reference the poem, picturing van Oosterwijck, with palette and brushes, as a painter-muse, serving as an inspiration to Schelte the poet.  She taught her servant Geertgen Wyntges, also known as Geertje Pieters, to mix her paints, and trained her as a painter too. After van Oosterwijck died, Wyntges lived independently, supporting herself as a painter.  In 1689, van Oosterwijck created her last known painting, a still life which is in the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen at London's Kensington Palace. This painting, Still Life with Flowers, Insects and a Shell, was acquired by the Royal Collection during Queen Anne's reign, as was another van Oosterwijck work.  Maria van Oosterwijck died at her home in Uitdam, North Holland, about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) northeast of Amsterdam, in 1693. The date of her death is often reported as 12 November, but some sources claim it was in December.  Arnold Houbraken, a contemporary biographer of Dutch Golden Age artists, eulogized van Oosterwijck, but did not consider her to be a professional artist, despite the very large sums paid for her paintings by such high-profile collectors as various members of European royalty.  Van Oosterwijck created floral paintings and still lifes with allegorical themes during a period in which such works were much sought after in Central Europe. She and Ruysch were judged to be the most eminent still life painters of the Low Countries. Van Oosterwijck's work, using luminous colours, is very richly detailed, sometimes demonstrating chiaroscuro techniques in her use of light and shadow. She frequently painted dark backgrounds, which resulted in increased brilliance of the foregrounds. She helped to transform the genre of the floral still life, painting realistically in a manner similar to the 16th-century Dutch trompe-l'œil tradition. There are very few existing pieces that have been identified as being by van Oosterwijck, most of which are florals, but Houbraken determined that she had created many other still lifes. She is thought to have produced 30 paintings in her career. Many of her paintings were small-format. This was often the case for artists of the time, as large pieces tended to restrict sales opportunities to wealthier clients such as churches or the state.  Through the use of symbolic elements, her paintings reflect themes commonly found in Dutch still life of the 17th-century, such as vanity, impermanence, and the obligation to devote oneself to God. Her vanitas paintings incorporate objects intended to symbolize the ephemeral nature of life; such objects may include skulls, hourglasses, books, globes, partially eaten food, bags of money, insects, wilted leaves, and flowers. She also included symbols of resurrection, giving her work a subtle bitter-sweet quality which is in contrast to some other artists of the time who sometimes, for example, would depict a large pile of skulls in order to deliver the moral message in their vanitas paintings.  Van Oosterwijck was very religious, and she often symbolically represented her deeply held beliefs in her paintings. The sunflower is symbolic of turning to God. Grapes take on a symbolic religious meaning because of their use to make eucharistic wine. Even colours are used symbolically, with white denoting innocence, yellow indicating divinity, and red symbolizing martyrdom.  Van Oosterwijck painted a recurring poetic embellishment into her still lifes. The red admiral butterfly (Vanessa atalanta) appears in various locations within most of her substantial paintings, sometimes resting on a flower stem, or on the edge of a table with a flower vase, or on a book. The butterfly was used as a device to draw the viewer's attention into the painting and into van Oosterwijck's artistic vision. The butterflies are also symbolic of Christ's resurrection.",female,Nootdorp,Uitdam
Catharina Oostfries,Q2230822,"Catharina Oostfries, or Trijntje Sieuwerts (1636–1708) was a Dutch Golden Age glass painter.  Oostfries was born in Nieuwkoop.  According to Houbraken she kept up her drawing and glass painting into her seventies.  According to the RKD she was the daughter of Siewert Oostvries, and was also known as Trijntje Siewerts. She was trained by her older brother Jozef Oostfries, a respected glass painter in Hoorn.

She is mentioned in Cornelis de Bie's book on painters in his chapter on noteworthy female painters. She is mentioned in Van der Aa as a fruit painter who was possibly the same person as Clara Peeters. Whether the two women were related is unknown.

Clara Peeters,Q265398,"Clara Peeters (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈklaːraː ˈpeːtərs]; fl. 1607–1621) was a Flemish still-life painter from Antwerp who worked in both the Spanish Netherlands and Dutch Republic.  Peeters is the best-known female Flemish artist of this era and one of the few women artists working professionally in seventeenth-century Europe, despite restrictions on women's access to artistic training and membership in guilds. Peeters specialized in still-life paintings with food and was prominent among the artists who shaped the traditions of the Netherlandish ontbijtjes, ""breakfast pieces,"" scenes of food and simple vessels, and banketjes, ""banquet pieces"" with expensive cups and vessels in precious metals.  Details of Peeters' life are unclear. It is generally agreed by scholars that her work points to her being a native of Antwerp. The city of Antwerp's archives hold a record of a Clara Peeters, daughter of Jean (Jan) Peeters, baptized on 15 May 1594 in the Church of St. Walburga in Antwerp. A second document indicates a marriage between a Clara Peeters and Henricus Joosen on 31 May 1639, in the same church. However, both Clara and especially Peeters were common names in Antwerp. A baptism in 1594 would imply that her 1607-dated paintings were done when she was 12 or 13. Some scholars doubt that those early works could have been done by one so young and have posited that she was born in the 1580s.  Peeters was established in Amsterdam by 1611 and documented in The Hague in 1617. Some have suggested that in light of there not being any evident work by Peeters after 1621, she ceased painting after getting married, as for example Judith Leyster effectively did. Because of the number of apparent copies of her work by various hands, some speculate that she may have headed a small school of artists. No record indicating Peeters' date of death has been found; however, scholars speculate various dates: in or after 1621; after 1654; after 1657; 1659 and 1676.  Peeters' first-known painting, signed and dated 1607, reflects the technical and compositional skill of a trained artist. Her style suggests training in Antwerp, an early center of still-life specialization.  While most artists and apprentices were included in records of the local Guild of Saint Luke, no record of Peeters' has been found in Antwerp or centers of art in the Dutch Republic. Scholars speculate that she may have been the daughter of a painter, and thus not required to be included in the apprenticeship records.  Many scholars believe her work closely resembles that of Osias Beert and suggest she may have been his pupil. Beert began his career as a still-life painter when he became a master of the Antwerp guild in 1602. However, none of his works are dated, although some of the copper plates were stamped with dates from 1606 to 1609 by their supplier. She has also been linked to Antwerp artists Hans van Essen and Jan van der Beeck. Jan Bruegel the Elder has also been suggested as a possible teacher.  Although she was not in its records, at least one painting of Peeters bears the stamp of the Antwerp Guild on its back, indicating she may indeed have been a member, or at least worked on panels made by members of the Antwerp Guild.  Peeters signed thirty-one works ""CLARA PEETERS"" or ""CLARA P."", and dated many of them, which leaves a strong record of her work from 1607 to 1621. Eighteen of these were completed by the time she was eighteen years old. In addition, another seventy-six works are speculated to be in her oeuvre, although documentation is lacking to assign them affirmatively to Peeters. Several of her paintings, including two illustrated here, carry the signature represented as an engraved inscription on the side of the handle of the same decorated knife. The knife has two nude female figures on the main face of the handle that is visible, and is typical of the sort of ""brides knife"" (bruidmessen) Antwerp silversmiths produced around 1595–1600. These may represent a real knife owned by Peeters, or simply an imagined one.  Peeters was among the earliest specialist painters of still lifes and flowers, working while this genre was still emerging. Fewer than ten paintings of flowers and fewer than five of food produced in the Netherlands can be dated before 1608, when she painted her first recorded work. She painted a set of four larger than usual (all 50‒51 × 71‒73 cm) still lifes, three dated 1611, that were in the Spanish royal collection by the following century (now in the Prado). The set includes the earliest still-life of dead game birds, if Jacopo de' Barbari's famous Still-Life with Partridge and Gauntlets (1504, now Munich) from a very different tradition is excepted. The Prado group were split between Spanish palaces in the 18th century, with the earliest inventory record for any being in 1734, when one was rescued in the fire that destroyed the Royal Alcazar of Madrid. Her paintings of fish and game of 1611 appear well before other artists used similar subject matter.  In her works before 1620, Peeters was especially fascinated by the fall of light on metal objects – coins, goblets, pewter dishes, etc. – and their reflections. She depicted herself in the reflection of goblets and gilt-cups of many of her paintings, a custom in Netherlandish art dating back over a century, as seen in works like Jan van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–1436).  Scholars speculate, based on the continual use of the same motifs and differing quality of work in some of her paintings, that Peeters may have run her own workshop and tasked her students with painting these repetitive motifs.  Although no record of patrons is available, it appears Peeters was a successful artist. Many aspects of her paintings suggest that her paintings would have been created for wealthy collectors, as they are particularly large and depict luxury items of the era.  Four of Peeter's early works came to the Prado from the Spanish royal collection, and one is found listed in a collection from 1627, while another is listed in a document of a notary in 1628.",female,Antwerp,The Hague
Katharina Pepijn,Q19665620,"Katharina Pepijn or Catharina Pepijn (baptized on 13 February 1619, Antwerp - 12 November 1688, Antwerp) was a Flemish painter who was known for her history paintings and portraits.  Very little is known about the life or career of Katharina Pepijn. She was the daughter of Marten Pepijn and Marie Huybrechts. She likely trained with her father, a prominent painter in Antwerp. In 1654, she became a member of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke as a 'wijnmeester', i.e. the daughter of a master.  At the end of her life, she was renting a house in a beguinage.  She was taken ill and was cared for by a nurse.  After she died, she was buried at Antwerp Cathedral.  Katharina Pepijn was known in her time as a history and portrait painter.  Currently, only two works are attributed to Katharina Pepijn. Both are portraits of abbots of St. Michael's Abbey, Antwerp, executed with oil on canvas in the 1650s. That of Abbot Johannes Chrysostomus vander Sterre was made shortly after his death in 1652. The other is of Abbot Norbertus van Couwerven. Both paintings were originally kept at St. Michael's Abbey.

Rembrandt,Q5598,"Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (/ˈrɛmbrænt, ˈrɛmbrɑːnt/; Dutch: [ˈrɛmbrɑnt ˈɦɑrmə(n)ˌsoːɱ vɑn ˈrɛin] ⓘ; 15 July 1606 – 4 October 1669), mononymously known as Rembrandt, was a Dutch Golden Age painter, printmaker, and draughtsman. He is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of Western art. It is estimated that Rembrandt's surviving works amount to about three hundred paintings, three hundred etchings, and several hundred drawings.  Unlike most Dutch painters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of styles and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological subjects and animal studies. His contributions to art came in a period that historians call the Dutch Golden Age.   Rembrandt never went abroad, but was considerably influenced by the work of the Italian Old Masters and Dutch and Flemish artists who had studied in Italy.  After he achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained high, and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters. Rembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs. His approximately 40 self-portraits form an intimate autobiography.  Rembrandt[a] Harmenszoon van Rijn was born on 15 July 1606 in Leiden, in the Dutch Republic, now the Netherlands. He was the ninth child born to Harmen Gerritszoon van Rijn and Neeltgen Willemsdochter van Zuijtbrouck. His family was quite well-to-do; his father was a miller and his mother was a baker's daughter. His mother was Catholic, and his father belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church. Religion is a central theme in Rembrandt's works and the religiously fraught period in which he lived makes his faith a matter of interest.  As a boy, he attended a Latin school. In 1620, he was enrolled at the University of Leiden, although he had a greater inclination towards painting and was soon apprenticed to Jacob van Swanenburg, with whom he spent three years. After a brief but important apprenticeship of six months with the history painter Pieter Lastman in Amsterdam, Rembrandt stayed a few months with Jacob Pynas in 1625, though Simon van Leeuwen claimed that Rembrandt was taught by Joris van Schooten and then started his own workshop.  In 1625, Rembrandt opened a studio in Leiden, which he shared with friend and colleague Jan Lievens. In 1627, Rembrandt began to accept students, among them Gerrit Dou and Isaac de Jouderville. Joan Huydecoper is mentioned as the first buyer of a Rembrandt painting in 1628. In 1629, Rembrandt was discovered by the statesman Constantijn Huygens who procured for Rembrandt important commissions from the court of The Hague. As a result of this connection, Prince Frederik Hendrik continued to purchase paintings from Rembrandt.  At the end of 1631, Rembrandt moved to Amsterdam, a city rapidly expanding as the business and trade capital. He began to practice as a professional portraitist for the first time, with great success. He initially stayed with an art dealer, Hendrick van Uylenburgh, and in 1634, married Hendrick's cousin, Saskia van Uylenburgh. Saskia came from a respected family: her father Rombertus was a lawyer and had been burgomaster (mayor) of Leeuwarden.  The couple married in the local church of St. Annaparochie without the presence of Rembrandt's relatives. In the same year, Rembrandt became a citizen of Amsterdam and a member of the local guild of painters. He also acquired a number of students, among them Ferdinand Bol and Govert Flinck.  In 1635, Rembrandt and Saskia rented a fashionable lodging with a view of the river Amstel. In 1637, Rembrandt moved upriver to Vlooienburg, in a building on the previous site of the current Stopera. In May 1639 they moved to a recently modernized house in the upscale 'Breestraat' with artists and art dealers; Nicolaes Pickenoy, a portrait painter, was his neighbor. The mortgage to finance the 13,000 guilder purchase would be a cause for later financial difficulties.[b] The neighborhood sheltered many immigrants and was becoming the Jewish quarter. It was there that Rembrandt frequently sought his Jewish neighbors to model for his Old Testament scenes.  One of the great patrons at the early stages of his career was Amsterdam statesman Andries de Graeff.  Although they were by now affluent, the couple suffered several personal setbacks; three children died within weeks of their births.[c][d] Only their fourth child, Titus, who was born in 1641, survived into adulthood. Saskia died in 1642, probably from tuberculosis. Rembrandt's drawings of her on her sick and death bed are among his most moving works.  After Saskia's illness, the widow Geertje Dircx was hired as Titus' caretaker and dry nurse; at some time, she also became Rembrandt's lover. In May 1649 she left and charged Rembrandt with breach of promise  and asked to be awarded alimony. Rembrandt tried to settle the matter amicably, but to pay her lawyer she pawned the diamond ring he had given her that once belonged to Saskia. On 14 October they came to an agreement; the court particularly stated that Rembrandt had to pay a yearly maintenance allowance, provided that Titus remained her only heir and she sold none of Rembrandt's possessions. As Dircx broke her promise, Rembrandt and members of Dircx's own family had her committed to a women's house of correction at Gouda in August 1650. Rembrandt also took measures to ensure she stayed in the house of correction for as long as possible. Rembrandt paid for the costs.[e]  In early 1649, Rembrandt began a relationship with the 23-year-old Hendrickje Stoffels, who had initially been his maid. She may have been the cause of Geertje's leaving. In that year he made no (dated) paintings or etchings at all. In 1654 Rembrandt painted a nude Bathsheba at Her Bath. In June Hendrickje received three summonses from the Reformed Church to answer the charge ""that she had committed the acts of a whore with Rembrandt the painter"". In July she admitted her guilt and was banned from receiving communion. Rembrandt was not summoned to appear for the Church council. In October they had a daughter, Cornelia. Had he remarried he would have lost access to a trust set up for Titus in Saskia's will.  Rembrandt, despite his artistic success, found himself in financial turmoil. His penchant for acquiring art, prints, and rare items led him to live beyond his means. In January 1653 the sale of the property formally was finalized but Rembrandt still had to cover half of the remaining mortgage. Creditors began pressing for installments but Rembrandt, facing financial strain, sought a postponement. The  house required repairs prompting Rembrandt to borrow money from friends, including Jan Six.[f]  In November 1655, amid a year overshadowed by plague and the drafting of wills, Rembrandt's 14-year-old son Titus took a significant step by drafting a will that designated his father as the sole heir, effectively sidelining his mother's family. In December Rembrandt orchestrated a sale of his paintings, yet the earnings failed to meet expectations. This tumultuous period deeply impacted the art industry, prompting Rembrandt to seek a high court arrangement known as cessio bonorum.  Despite the financial difficulties, Rembrandt's bankruptcy was not forced. In July 1656, he declared his insolvency, taking stock and willingly surrendered his assets. Notably, he had already transferred the house to his son.  Both the authorities and his creditors showed leniency, granting him ample time to settle his debts. Jacob J. Hinlopen allegedly played a role.  In November 1657 another auction was held to sell his paintings, as well as a substantial number of etching plates and drawings, some of the latter by famous artists including Raphael, Mantegna and Giorgione.[g] Remarkably, Rembrandt was permitted to retain his tools  as a means of generating income. Rembrandt lost the guardianship of his son and thus control over his actions. A new guardian, Louis Crayers, claimed the house in settlement of Titus's debt.  The sale list comprising 363 items offers insight into Rembrandt's diverse collections, which encompassed Old Master paintings, drawings, busts of Roman emperors, statues of Greek philosophers, books (a bible), two globes, bonnets, armor, and various objects from Asia (porcelain), as well as a collections of natural history specimens (two lion skins, a bird-of-paradise, corals and minerals). Unfortunately, the prices realized in the sale were disappointing.  By February 1658, Rembrandt' house was sold at a foreclosure auction, and the family moved to more modest lodgings at Rozengracht.  In 1660, he finished Ahasuerus and Haman at the feast of Esther which he sold to Jan J. Hinlopen. Early December 1660, the sale of the house was finalized but the proceeds went directly to Titus' guardian.  Two weeks later, Hendrickje and Titus established a dummy corporation as art dealers, allowing Rembrandt, who had board and lodging, to continue his artistic pursuits. In 1661, they secured a contract for a major project at the newly completed town hall. The resulting work, The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis, was rejected by the mayors and returned to the painter within a few weeks; the surviving fragment (in Stockholm) is only a quarter of the original.  Despite these setbacks, Rembrandt continued to receive significant portrait commissions and completed notable works, such as the Sampling Officials in 1662.  It remains a challenge to gauge Rembrandt's wealth accurately as he may have overestimated the value of his art collection. Nonetheless, half of his assets were earmarked for Titus' inheritance.  In March 1663, with Hendrickje's illness, Titus assumed a more prominent role. Isaac van Hertsbeeck, Rembrandt's primary creditor, went to the High Court and contested Titus' priority for payment, leading to legal battles that Titus ultimately won in 1665 when he came of age. During this time, Rembrandt worked on notable pieces like the Jewish Bride and his final self-portraits but struggled with rent arrears. Notably, Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, visited Rembrandt twice, and returned to Florence with one of the self-portraits.  Rembrandt outlived both Hendrickje and Titus;  he died on Friday 4 October 1669 and was buried four days later in a rented grave in the Westerkerk.  His illegitimate child, Cornelia (1654–1684), eventually moved to Batavia in 1670 accompanied by an obscure painter  and her mother's inheritance. Titus' considerable inheritance passed to his only child, Titia (1669-1715) who married her cousin and lived at Blauwburgwal. Rembrandt's life was marked by more than just artistic achievements; he navigated numerous legal and financial challenges, leaving a complex legacy.  In a letter to Huygens, Rembrandt offered the only surviving explanation of what he sought to achieve through his art, writing that, ""the greatest and most natural movement"", translated from de meeste en de natuurlijkste beweegelijkheid. The word ""beweegelijkheid"" translates to ""emotion"" or ""motive"". Whether this refers to objectives, material, or something else, is not known but critics have drawn particular attention to the way Rembrandt seamlessly melded the earthly and spiritual.  Earlier 20th century connoisseurs claimed Rembrandt had produced well over 600 paintings, nearly 400 etchings and 2,000 drawings. More recent scholarship, from the 1960s to the present day (led by the Rembrandt Research Project), often controversially, has winnowed his oeuvre to nearer 300 paintings.[h] His prints, traditionally all called etchings, although many are produced in whole or part by engraving and sometimes drypoint, have a much more stable total of slightly under 300.[i] It is likely Rembrandt made many more drawings in his lifetime than 2,000 but those extant are rarer than presumed.[j] Two experts claim that the number of drawings whose autograph status can be regarded as effectively ""certain"" is no higher than about 75, although this is disputed. The list was to be unveiled at a scholarly meeting in February 2010.  At one time, approximately 90 paintings were counted as Rembrandt self-portraits but it is now known that he had his students copy his own self-portraits as part of their training. Modern scholarship has reduced the autograph count to over forty paintings, as well as a few drawings and thirty-one etchings, which include many of the most remarkable images of the group. Some show him posing in quasi-historical fancy dress, or pulling faces at himself. His oil paintings trace the progress from an uncertain young man, through the dapper and very successful portrait-painter of the 1630s, to the troubled but massively powerful portraits of his old age. Together they give a remarkably clear picture of the man, his appearance and his psychological make-up, as revealed by his richly weathered face.[k]  In his portraits and self-portraits, he angles the sitter's face in such a way that the ridge of the nose nearly always forms the line of demarcation between brightly illuminated and shadowy areas. A Rembrandt face is a face partially eclipsed; and the nose, bright and obvious, thrusting into the riddle of halftones, serves to focus the viewer's attention upon, and to dramatize, the division between a flood of light—an overwhelming clarity—and a brooding duskiness.  In some of his biblical works, including The Raising of the Cross, Joseph Telling His Dreams, and The Stoning of Saint Stephen, Rembrandt painted himself as a character in the crowd. Durham suggests that this was because the Bible was for Rembrandt ""a kind of diary, an account of moments in his own life"".  Among the more prominent characteristics of Rembrandt's work are his use of chiaroscuro, the theatrical employment of light and shadow derived from Caravaggio, or, more likely, from the Dutch Caravaggisti but adapted for very personal means. Also notable are his dramatic and lively presentation of subjects, devoid of the rigid formality that his contemporaries often displayed, and a deeply felt compassion for mankind, irrespective of wealth and age. His immediate family—his wife Saskia, his son Titus and his common-law wife Hendrickje—often figured prominently in his paintings, many of which had mythical, biblical or historical subjects.  Throughout his career, Rembrandt took as his most common subjects portraits, narrative or ""history paintings"", mostly biblical, and landscapes. He was especially praised by his contemporaries for his biblical subjects, for his skill in representing emotions, and attention to detail. Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early ""smooth"" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late ""rough"" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself. Rembrandt must have realized that if he kept the paint deliberately loose and ""paint-like"" on some parts of the canvas, the perception of space became much greater.  A parallel development may be seen in Rembrandt's skill as a printmaker. In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well. The works encompass a wide range of subject matter and technique, sometimes leaving large areas of white paper to suggest space, at other times employing complex webs of line to produce rich dark tones.  Lastman's influence on Rembrandt was most prominent during his period in Leiden from 1625 to 1631. Paintings were rather small but rich in details (for example, in costumes and jewelry). Religious and allegorical subjects were favored, as were tronies. In 1626 Rembrandt produced his first etchings, the wide dissemination of which would largely account for his international fame. In 1629, he completed Judas Repentant, Returning the Pieces of Silver and The Artist in His Studio, works that evidence his interest in the handling of light and variety of paint application and constitute the first major progress in his development as a painter.  During his early years in Amsterdam (1632–1636), Rembrandt began to paint dramatic biblical and mythological scenes in high contrast and of large format (The Blinding of Samson, 1636, Belshazzar's Feast, c. 1635 Danaë, 1636 but reworked later), seeking to emulate the baroque style of Rubens. With the occasional help of assistants in Uylenburgh's workshop, he painted numerous portrait commissions both small (Jacob de Gheyn III) and large (Portrait of the Shipbuilder Jan Rijcksen and his Wife, 1633, Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, 1632).  By the late 1630s, Rembrandt had produced a few paintings and many etchings of landscapes. Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (Cottages before a Stormy Sky, c. 1641; The Three Trees, 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the New Testament than the Old Testament, as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted The Night Watch, the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.  In the decade following the Night Watch, Rembrandt's paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (Susanna and the Elders, 1637–47). At the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.  In the 1650s, Rembrandt's style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of Titian, and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of 'finish' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt's brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings. The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting's surface. The result is a richly varied handling of paint, deeply layered and often apparently haphazard, which suggests form and space in both an illusory and highly individual manner.  In later years, biblical subjects were often depicted but emphasis shifted from dramatic group scenes to intimate portrait-like figures (James the Apostle, 1661). In his last years, Rembrandt painted his most deeply reflective self-portraits (from 1652 to 1669 he painted fifteen), and several moving images of both men and women (The Jewish Bride, c. 1666)—in love, in life, and before God.  Rembrandt produced etchings for most of his career, from 1626 to 1660, when he was forced to sell his printing-press and practically abandoned etching. Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work. He took easily to etching and, though he learned to use a burin and partly engraved many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.  He worked on the so-called Hundred Guilder Print in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the ""critical work in the middle of his career"", from which his final etching style began to emerge. Although the print only survives in two states, the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.  In the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used hatching to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including Japanese paper, which he used frequently, and on vellum. He began to use ""surface tone"", leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of drypoint, exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.  His prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the 27 self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. The landscapes, mostly small, largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century. Of the many hundreds of drawings Rembrandt made, only about two hundred have a landscape motif as their subject, and of the approximately three hundred etchings, about thirty show a landscape. As for his painted landscapes, one does not even get beyond eight works. One third of his etchings are of religious subjects, many treated with a homely simplicity, whilst others are his most monumental prints. A few erotic, or just obscene, compositions have no equivalent in his paintings. Rembrandt owned, until forced to sell it, a magnificent collection of works by other artists. He was influenced by artists including Caravaggio with his chiaroscuro lighting. Borrowings and influences in his work can be traced to artists as diverse as Andrea Mantegna (with his Entombment), Anthony van Dyck, Raphael, Titian, Peter Paul Rubens, Hercules Seghers, and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione.  Drawings by Rembrandt and his pupils/followers have been extensively studied by many artists and scholars[l] through the centuries.  Rembrandt was interested in Mughal miniatures, especially around the 1650s. He drew versions of some 23 Mughal paintings and may have owned an album of them. These miniatures include paintings of Shah Jahan, Akbar, Jahangir and Dara Shikoh and may have influenced the costumes and other aspects of his works.  Rembrandt painted The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq, known as The Night Watch, between 1640 and 1642, and it became his most famous work. The piece was commissioned for the new hall of the Kloveniersdoelen, the musketeer branch of the civic militia. Rembrandt departed from convention on both narrative painting and portraits, which ordered that such genre pieces should be stately and formal. Instead, he created a complex layering of figures in a dramatic depiction of an action, the firing of a musket, affecting some of the characters but not others. The painting is not set at night, its darkness being caused by ageing; and it is not of a watch or patrol, but a ceremony.  The painting has received many interpretations; if as Joseph Manca suggests it was meant to function at multiple levels, many of the interpretations may be correct. Thus, unlike in a conventional narrative painting, the people depicted are represented in lifelike individual portraits. The style seems to show a real event in a real place, but its complex structure appears contrived or theatrical, while the street setting is invented. It can be seen as a picture of a militia charged with keeping order, but it equally looks like a disorderly scene. It alludes to serious works like The School of Athens by Raphael, and has been seen as humorous or parodic. Manca suggests that the calmness of the two officers in the foreground, continuing to carry out their duty despite the disturbance behind them, indicates their ""moral excellence""; certainly, their status is clearly indicated, even flattered.  In 1968, the Rembrandt Research Project began under the sponsorship of the Netherlands Organization for the Advancement of Scientific Research; it was initially expected to last a highly optimistic ten years. Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new catalogue raisonné of his paintings. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.  One example of activity is The Polish Rider, now in the Frick Collection in New York. Rembrandt's authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, Julius S. Held, agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr. Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt's closest and most talented pupils, Willem Drost, about whom little is known. But Bruyn's remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost's authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading ""Rembrandt"" and not ""attributed to"" or ""school of"". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick; In his 1999 book Rembrandt's Eyes, Simon Schama and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both argued for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt's authorship feel that the execution is uneven and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.  A similar issue was raised by Schama concerning the verification of titles associated with the subject matter depicted in Rembrandt's works. For example, the exact subject being portrayed in Aristotle with a Bust of Homer, recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum, has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw. Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter Apelles who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.  Another painting, Pilate Washing His Hands, is also of questionable attribution. Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as ""a somewhat abnormal work"" by Rembrandt. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master's command of illumination and modeling.  The attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing. In 2005 four oil paintings previously attributed to Rembrandt's students were reclassified as the work of Rembrandt himself: Study of an Old Man in Profile and Study of an Old Man with a Beard from a US private collection, Study of a Weeping Woman, owned by the Detroit Institute of Arts, and Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet, painted in 1640. The Old Man Sitting in a Chair is a further example: in 2014, Professor Ernst van de Wetering offered his view to The Guardian that the demotion of the 1652 painting Old Man Sitting in a Chair ""was a vast mistake...it is a most important painting. The painting needs to be seen in terms of Rembrandt's experimentation"". This was highlighted much earlier by Nigel Konstam who studied Rembrandt throughout his career.  Rembrandt's own studio practice is a major factor in the difficulty of attribution, since, like many masters before him, he encouraged his students to copy his paintings, sometimes finishing or retouching them to be sold as originals, and sometimes selling them as authorized copies. Additionally, his style proved easy enough for his most talented students to emulate. Further complicating matters is the uneven quality of some of Rembrandt's own work, and his frequent stylistic evolutions and experiments. As well, there were later imitations of his work, and restorations which so seriously damaged the original works that they are no longer recognizable.  Technical investigation of Rembrandt's paintings in the possession of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister and in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel) was conducted by Hermann Kühn in 1977. The pigment analyses of some thirty paintings have shown that Rembrandt's palette consisted of the following pigments: lead white, various ochres, Vandyke brown, bone black, charcoal black, lamp black, vermilion, madder lake, azurite, ultramarine, yellow lake and lead-tin-yellow. Synthetic orpiment was shown in the shadows of the sleeve of the jewish groom. This toxic arsenic yellow was rarely used in oil painting. One painting (Saskia van Uylenburgh as Flora) reportedly contains gamboge. Rembrandt very rarely used pure blue or green colors, the most pronounced exception being Belshazzar's Feast in the National Gallery in London.  The book by Bomford describes more recent technical investigations and pigment analyses of Rembrandt's paintings predominantly in the National Gallery in London. The entire array of pigments employed by Rembrandt can be found at ColourLex. The best source for technical information on Rembrandt's paintings on the web is the Rembrandt Database containing all works of Rembrandt with detailed investigative reports, infrared and radiography images and other scientific details.  ""Rembrandt"" is a modification of the spelling of the artist's first name that he introduced in 1633. ""Harmenszoon"" indicates that his father's name is Harmen. ""van Rijn"" indicates that his family lived near the Rhine.  Rembrandt's earliest signatures (c. 1625) consisted of an initial ""R"", or the monogram ""RH"" (for Rembrant Harmenszoon), and starting in 1629, ""RHL"" (the ""L"" stood, presumably, for Leiden). In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, ""RHL-van Rijn"" but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, ""Rembrant"". In 1633 he added a ""d"", and maintained this form consistently from then on, proving that this minor change had a meaning for him (whatever it might have been). This change is purely visual; it does not change the way his name is pronounced. Curiously enough, despite the large number of paintings and etchings signed with this modified first name, most of the documents that mentioned him during his lifetime retained the original ""Rembrant"" spelling. (Note: the rough chronology of signature forms above applies to the paintings, and to a lesser degree to the etchings; from 1632, presumably, there is only one etching signed ""RHL-v. Rijn"", the large-format ""Raising of Lazarus"", B 73).  His practice of signing his work with his first name, later followed by Vincent van Gogh, was probably inspired by Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo who, then as now, were referred to by their first names alone.  Rembrandt ran a large workshop and had many pupils. The list of Rembrandt pupils from his period in Leiden as well as his time in Amsterdam is quite long, mostly because his influence on painters around him was so great that it is difficult to tell whether someone worked for him in his studio or just copied his style for patrons eager to acquire a Rembrandt. A partial list should include Ferdinand Bol, Adriaen Brouwer, Gerrit Dou, Willem Drost, Heiman Dullaart, Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, Carel Fabritius, Govert Flinck, Hendrick Fromantiou, Aert de Gelder, Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten, Abraham Janssens, Godfrey Kneller, Philip de Koninck, Jacob Levecq, Nicolaes Maes, Jürgen Ovens, Christopher Paudiß, Willem de Poorter, Jan Victors, and Willem van der Vliet.  The United States has the largest number of Rembrandt's paintings, spread over several museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art (mostly portraits) and the Frick Collection in New York City, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, in total 86 paintings. Other large groups are in Germany, with 69 paintings, at the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin, Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, and Schloss Wilhelmshöhe in Kassel, and elsewhere. The UK has a total of 51, especially in the National Gallery and Royal Collection. There are 49 in the Netherlands, many in the Rijksmuseum, which has The Night Watch and The Jewish Bride, and the Mauritshuis in The Hague. Others can be found in The Louvre, the Hermitage Museum, and Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. The Royal Castle in Warsaw has two paintings by Rembrandt.  Large collections of Rembrandt's drawings are held in the Rijksmuseum,  the Louvre, and the British Museum.  The Rembrandt House Museum holds many of his drawings and ""almost all"" the etchings, a selection of which are on rotating display in the house.  Apart from a few very rare prints, mostly less important early studies, or ""the informal printed scribbles from the artist's early years"", most of his prints are not very rare by museum standards, and major print rooms have good collections.  Both the Rijksmuseum and the British Museum, who claim to have the best collections, have over 1,000 impressions of the 300-odd prints; most of these can be viewed in great detail online. The degree to which these collections are displayed to the public or can easily be viewed by them in the print room, varies greatly. The Morgan Library & Museum in New York claims to have the best collection in America, with ""impressions of most of the three hundred or so known etchings by Rembrandt, as well as multiple, often exceedingly rare impressions of various states""; it has ""almost 500"" images online.  Impressions often continued to be printed by others until at least the 19th-century, with many of the plates reworked as they became worn. In 1986, 79 of Rembrandt's original copper plates still existed.",male,Leiden,Amsterdam
Cornelia de Rijck,Q19754740,"Cornelia de Rijck (11 October 1653 – 4 October 1726) was a Dutch painter specialized in painting birds and insects.  She was born in Amsterdam as the daughter of Dirck Jansz. de Rijck and Ariaantje Wessels. She married Gerrit van Goor in 1688, followed by a second marriage to Simon Schijnvoet in 1697. Her first husband was a portrait painter who painted her portrait, and together they taught the artist Gerrit Rademaker who continued to follow lessons from her as a widow.  She is known for her meticulous studies of insects, 116 of which are in a portfolio in the Stockholm archives. Her paintings have been compared to those of Melchior d'Hondecoeter.  She died in Amsterdam.",female,Amsterdam,Amsterdam
Jacob van Ruisdael,Q213612,"Jacob Isaackszoon van Ruisdael (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈjaːkɔp fɑn ˈrœyzdaːl] ⓘ; c. 1629 – 10 March 1682) was a Dutch painter, draughtsman, and etcher. He is generally considered the pre-eminent landscape painter of the Dutch Golden Age, a period of great wealth and cultural achievement when Dutch painting became highly popular.  Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael depicted a wide variety of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality for a young man. After a trip to Germany in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he lived and worked in Amsterdam, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky often took up two-thirds of the canvas. In total he produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls.  Ruisdael's only registered pupil was Meindert Hobbema, one of several artists who painted figures in his landscapes. Hobbema's work has at times been confused with Ruisdael's. Ruisdael always spelt his name thus: Ruisdael, not Ruysdael.  Ruisdael's work was in demand in the Dutch Republic during his lifetime. Today it is spread across private and institutional collections around the world; the National Gallery in London, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg hold the largest collections. Ruisdael shaped landscape painting traditions worldwide, from the English Romantics to the Barbizon school in France, and the Hudson River School in the US, and influenced generations of Dutch landscape artists.  Jacob Isaackszoon van Ruisdael was born in Haarlem in 1628 or 1629[A] into a family of painters, all landscapists.  The number of painters in the family, and the multiple spellings of the van Ruisdael name, have hampered attempts to document his life and attribute his works. The name Ruisdael is connected to a castle, now lost, in the village of Blaricum. The village was the home of Jacob's grandfather, the furniture maker Jacob de Goyer. When de Goyer moved away to Naarden, three of his sons changed their name to van Ruysdael or van Ruisdael, probably to indicate their origin.[B] Two of De Goyer's sons became painters: Jacob's father Isaack van Ruisdael and his well-known uncle Salomon van Ruysdael.[C] Jacob himself always spelled his name with an ""i"", while his cousin, Salomon's son Jacob Salomonszoon van Ruysdael, also a landscape artist, spelled his name with a ""y"". Jacob's earliest biographer, Arnold Houbraken, called him Jakob Ruisdaal.  It is not known whether Ruisdael's mother was Isaack van Ruisdael's first wife, whose name is unknown, or his second wife, Maycken Cornelisdochter. Isaack and Maycken married on 12 November 1628.[D]  Ruisdael's teacher is also unknown. It is often assumed Ruisdael studied with his father and uncle, but there is no evidence for this. He appears to have been strongly influenced by other contemporary local Haarlem landscapists, most notably Cornelis Vroom and Allart van Everdingen.  The earliest date that appears on a Ruisdael painting and etching is 1646.[E] Two years after this date he was admitted to membership of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. By this time landscape paintings were as popular as history paintings in Dutch households, though at the time of Ruisdael's birth, history paintings appeared far more frequently. This growth in popularity of landscapes continued throughout Ruisdael's career.[F]  Around 1657, Ruisdael moved to Amsterdam, by then a prosperous city which was likely to have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there. On 17 June 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael lived and worked in Amsterdam for the rest of his life. In 1668, his name appears as a witness to the marriage of Meindert Hobbema, his only registered pupil, a painter whose works have, by some, been confused with Ruisdael's own.  For a landscape artist, it seems Ruisdael travelled relatively little: to Blaricum, Egmond aan Zee, and Rhenen in the 1640s, with Nicolaes Berchem to Bentheim and Steinfurt just across the border in Germany in 1650, and possibly with Hobbema across the German border again in 1661, via the Veluwe, Deventer and Ootmarsum. Despite Ruisdael's numerous Norwegian landscapes, there is no record of him having travelled to Scandinavia.  There is some speculation that Ruisdael was also a doctor. In 1718, his biographer Houbraken reports that he studied medicine and performed surgery in Amsterdam. Archival records of the 17th century show the name ""Jacobus Ruijsdael"" on a list of Amsterdam doctors, albeit crossed out, with the added remark that he earned his medical degree on 15 October 1676 in Caen, northern France. Various art historians have speculated that this was, in all probability, a case of mistaken identity. Pieter Scheltema suggests it was Ruisdael's cousin who appeared on the record. The Ruisdael expert Seymour Slive argues that the spelling ""uij"" is not consistent with Ruisdael's own spelling of his name, that his unusually high production suggests there was little time to study medicine, and that there is no indication in any of his art that he visited northern France. The evidence is inconclusive.  Ruisdael was not Jewish. Slive reports that, because of Ruisdael's depiction of a Jewish cemetery and various biblical names in the Ruisdael family, he often heard speculation that Ruisdael must surely be Jewish. The evidence shows otherwise. Ruisdael was buried in the Saint Bavo's Church, Haarlem, a Protestant church at that time. His uncle Salomon van Ruysdael belonged to the Young Flemish subgroup of the Mennonite congregation, one of several types of Anabaptists in Haarlem, and it is probable that Ruisdael's father was also a member there. His cousin Jacob was a registered Mennonite in Amsterdam.  Ruisdael did not marry. According to Houbraken, whose short biography does contain a few errors, this was ""to reserve time to serve his old father"". No likeness of Ruisdael is known to exist[G]  The art historian Hendrik Frederik Wijnman disproved the myth that Ruisdael died a poor man, supposedly in the old men's almshouse in Haarlem. Wijnman showed that the person who died there was in fact Ruisdael's cousin, Jacob Salomonszoon. Although there is no record of Ruisdael owning land or shares, he appears to have lived comfortably, even after the economic downturn of the disaster year 1672.[H] His paintings were valued fairly highly. In a large sample of inventories between 1650 and 1679 the average price for a Ruisdael was 40 guilders, compared to an average of 19 guilders for all attributed paintings. In a ranking of contemporary Dutch painters based on price-weighted frequency in these inventories, Ruisdael ranks seventh; Rembrandt ranks first.   Ruisdael died in Amsterdam on 10 March 1682. He was buried 14 March 1682 in Saint Bavo's Church, Haarlem. Ruisdael's work from c. 1646 to the early 1650s, when he was living in Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and laborious study of nature: dunes, woods, and atmospheric effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of spaciousness and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.  An exemplar of Ruisdael's early style is Dune Landscape, one of the earliest works, dated 1646. It breaks with the classic Dutch tradition of depicting broad views of dunes that include houses and trees flanked by distant vistas. Instead, Ruisdael places tree-covered dunes prominently at centre stage, with a cloudscape concentrating strong light on a sandy path. The resulting heroic effect is enhanced by the large size of the canvas, ""so unexpected in the work of an inexperienced painter"" according to Irina Sokolova, curator at the Hermitage Museum. The art historian Hofstede de Groot said of Dune Landscape: ""It is hardly credible that it should be the work of a boy of seventeen"".  Ruisdael's first panoramic landscape, View of Naarden with the Church at Muiderberg in the Distance, dates from 1647. The theme of an overwhelming sky and a distant town, in this case the birthplace of his father, is one he returned to in his later years.  For unknown reasons, Ruisdael almost entirely stopped dating his work from 1653. Only five works from the 1660s have a, partially obscured, year next to his signature; none from the 1670s and 1680s have a date. Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely based on detective work and speculation.  All thirteen known Ruisdael etchings come from his early period, with the first one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood and Forest Marsh with Travellers on a Bank as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.  Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes took on a more heroic character, with forms becoming larger and more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, is just one of a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are rightly considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.[I]  On his trip to Germany, Ruisdael encountered water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmond Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.  Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large boulders and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, they are based on previous art works, rather than on direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter Allart van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle, c. 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.  In this period Ruisdael started painting coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among the most dramatic is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated c. 1665, which depicts a primieval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.  During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.  The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the Picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens.  Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's The Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.  Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.  While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years. It does feature in his only known architectural subject, a drawing of the interior of the Old Church, as well as in views of the Dam, and the Panoramic view of the Amstel looking toward Amsterdam, one of Ruisdael's last paintings.  Figures are introduced sparingly into Ruisdael's compositions, and are by this period rarely from his own hand[J] but executed by various artists, including his pupil Meindert Hobbema, Nicolaes Berchem, Adriaen van de Velde, Philips Wouwerman, Jan Vonck, Thomas de Keyser, Gerrit Battem and Johannes Lingelbach.  In his 2001 catalogue raisonné, Slive attributes 694 paintings to Ruisdael and lists another 163 paintings with dubious or, he believes, incorrect attribution. There are three main reasons why there is uncertainty over whose hand painted various Ruisdael-style landscapes. Firstly, four members of the Ruysdael family were landscapists with similar signatures, some of which were later fraudulently altered into Jacob's. This is further complicated by the fact that Ruisdael used variations of his signature. This typically reads ""JvRuisdael"" or the monogram ""JVR"", sometimes using a small italic 's' and sometimes a Gothic long 's', such as on Landscape with Waterfall. Secondly, many 17th-century landscape paintings are unsigned and could be from pupils or copyists. Finally, fraudsters imitated Ruisdaels for financial gain, with the earliest case reported by Houbraken in 1718: a certain Jan Griffier the Elder could imitate Ruisdael's style so well that he often passed them off as genuine Ruisdaels, especially with figurines added in the style of the artist Wouwerman. There is no large-scale systematic approach to ascertaining Ruisdael's attributions, unlike the forensic science used to find the correct attributions of Rembrandt's paintings through the Rembrandt Research Project.  Ruisdael has shaped landscape painting traditions from the English Romantics to the Barbizon school in France, and the Hudson River School in the US, as well as generations of Dutch landscape artists. Among the English artists influenced by Ruisdael are Thomas Gainsborough, J. M. W. Turner, and John Constable. Gainsborough drew, in black chalk and grey wash, a copy of a Ruisdael in the 1740s—now both paintings are housed in the Louvre in Paris. Turner made many copies of Ruisdaels and even painted fantasy views of a nonexistent port he called Port Ruysdael. Constable also copied various drawings, etchings and paintings by Ruisdael, and was a great admirer from a young age. ""It haunts my mind and clings to my heart"", he wrote after seeing a Ruisdael. However, he thought Jewish Cemetery was a failure, because he considered that it attempted to convey something outside the reach of art.  In the 19th century, Vincent van Gogh acknowledged Ruisdael as a major influence, calling him sublime, but at the same time saying it would be a mistake to try to copy him. Van Gogh had two Ruisdael prints, The Bush and a Haerlempje, on his wall, and thought the Ruisdaels in the Louvre were ""magnificent, especially The Bush, Storm Off a Sea Coast and The Ray of Light"". His experience of the French countryside was informed by his memory of Ruisdael's art. Van Gogh's contemporary Claude Monet is also said to be indebted to Ruisdael. Similarly, Piet Mondrian's early abstract compositions the eventually led to the founding of De Stijl have been traced back to Ruisdael's panoramas.  Among art historians and critics, Ruisdael's reputation has had its ups and downs over the centuries. The first account, in 1718, is from Houbraken, who waxed lyrical over the technical mastery which allowed Ruisdael to realistically depict falling water and the sea. In 1781, Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy, admired the freshness and force of Ruisdael's landscapes. A couple of decades later other English critics were less impressed. In 1801, Henry Fuseli, professor at the Royal Academy, expressed his contempt for the entire Dutch School of Landscape, dismissing it as no more than a ""transcript of the spot"", a mere ""enumeration of hill and dale, clumps of trees"". Of note is that one of Fuseli's students was Constable, whose admiration for Ruisdael remained unchanged. Around the same time in Germany, the writer, statesman and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe lauded Ruisdael as a thinking artist, even a poet, saying ""he demonstrates remarkable skill in locating the exact point at which the creative faculty comes into contact with a lucid mind"". John Ruskin however, in 1860, raged against Ruisdael and other Dutch Golden Age landscapists, calling their landscapes places where ""we lose not only all faith in religion but all remembrance of it"". In 1915, the Dutch art historian Abraham Bredius called his compatriot not so much a painter as a poet.  More recent art historians have rated Ruisdael highly. Kenneth Clark described him as ""the greatest master of the natural vision before Constable"". Waldemar Januszczak finds him a marvellous storyteller. Januszczak does not consider Ruisdael the greatest landscape artist of all time, but is especially impressed by his works as a teenager: ""a prodigy whom we should rank at number 8 or 9 on the Mozart scale"". Slive states Ruisdael is acknowledged ""by general consent, as the pre-eminent landscapist of the Golden Age of Dutch art"".  ""Ruisdael really doesn't deserve to be underrated. ..[H]e was a prodigy whom we should rank at number 8 or 9 on the Mozart scale.""  Ruisdael is now seen as the leading artist of the ""classical"" phase in Dutch landscape art, which built upon the realism of the previous ""tonal"" phase. The tonal phase suggested atmosphere through the use of tonality, while the classical phase strived for a more grandiose effect, with paintings built up through a series of vigorous contrasts of solid form against the sky, and of light against shade, with a tree, animal, or windmill often singled out.  Although many of Ruisdael's works were on show in the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857, and various other grand exhibitions across the world since, it was not until 1981 that an exhibition was solely dedicated to him. Over fifty paintings and thirty-five drawings and etchings were exhibited, first at the Mauritshuis in The Hague, then, in 1982, at the Fogg Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2006, the Royal Academy in London hosted a Ruisdael Master of Landscape exhibition, displaying works from over fifty collections.  There are no 17th-century documents to indicate, either at first or second hand, what Ruisdael intended to convey through his art. While The Jewish Cemetery is universally accepted as an allegory for the fragility of life, how other works should be interpreted is much disputed. At one end of the spectrum is Henry Fuseli, who contends they have no meaning at all, and are simply a depiction of nature. At the other end is Franz Theodor Kugler who sees meaning in almost everything: ""They all display the silent power of Nature, who opposes with her mighty hand the petty activity of man, and with a solemn warning as it were, repels his encroachments"".  In the middle of the spectrum are scholars such as E. John Walford, who sees the works as ""not so much bearers of narrative or emblematic meanings but rather as images reflecting the fact that the visible world was essentially perceived as manifesting inherent spiritual significance"". Walford advocates abandoning the notion of ""disguised symbolism"". Perhaps Ruisdael's work can be interpreted according to the religious world view of his time: nature serves as the ""first book"" of God, both because of its inherent divine qualities and because of God's obvious concern for man and the world. The intention is spiritual, not moral.  Andrew Graham-Dixon asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists could not help but search everywhere for meaning. He says of the windmill in The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede that it symbolises ""the sheer hard work needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard the future of the nation's children"". The symmetries in the landscapes are ""reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow"". Slive is more reluctant to read too much into the work, but does put The Windmill in its contemporary religious context of man's dependence on the ""spirit of the Lord for life"". With regards to interpreting Ruisdael's Scandinavian paintings, he says ""My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls, torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of transcience and vanitas"".  Ruisdaels are scattered across collections globally, both private and institutional. The most notable collections are at the National Gallery in London, which holds twenty paintings; the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which holds sixteen paintings; the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, which holds nine, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, Spain has four (and two additional paintings attributed to Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael). In the US, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has five Ruisdaels in its collection, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in California has three.  On occasion a Ruisdael changes hands. In 2014, Dunes by the Sea was auctioned at Christie's in New York, and realised a price of $1,805,000. Of his surviving drawings, 140 in total, the Rijksmuseum, the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, the Kupferstich-Kabinett, Dresden, and the Hermitage each hold significant collections. Ruisdael's rare etchings are spread across institutions. No collection holds a print of each of the thirteen etchings. Of the five unique prints, the British Museum holds two, two are in the Albertina in Vienna, and one is in Amsterdam.  According to some, Ruisdael and his art should not be considered apart from the context of the incredible wealth and significant changes to the land that occurred during the Dutch Golden Age. In his study on 17th-century Dutch art and culture, Simon Schama remarks that ""it can never be overemphasized that the period between 1550 and 1650, when the political identity of an independent Netherlands nation was being established, was also a time of dramatic physical alteration of its landscape"". Ruisdael's depiction of nature and emergent Dutch technology are wrapped up in this. Christopher Joby places Ruisdael in the religious context of the Calvinism of the Dutch Republic. He states that landscape painting does conform to Calvin's requirement that only what is visible may be depicted in art, and that landscape paintings such as those of Ruisdael have an epistemological value which provides further support for their use within Reformed Churches.  The art historian Yuri Kuznetsov places Ruisdael's art in the context of the war of independence against Spain. Dutch landscape painters ""were called upon to make a portrait of their homeland, twice rewon by the Dutch people – first from the sea and later from foreign invaders"". Jonathan Israel, in his study of the Dutch Republic, calls the period between 1647 and 1672 the third phase of Dutch Golden Age art, in which wealthy merchants wanted large, opulent and refined paintings, and civic leaders filled their town halls with grand displays containing republican messages.  As well, ordinary middle class Dutch people began buying art for the first time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds.[K] Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly.[L] Under the master's direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings.[M] Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by pupils, to maximise both speed and price. Numerous art dealers organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael's case, it is not known whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers, or sold his work through dealers, or both. Art historians only know of one commission,[N] a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.[O]",male,Haarlem,Haarlem
Rachel Ruysch,Q234385,"Rachel Ruysch (3 June 1664 – 12 October 1750) was a Dutch still-life painter from the Dutch Republic. She specialized in flowers, inventing her own style and achieving international fame in her lifetime. Due to a long and successful career that spanned over six decades, she became the best documented female painter of the Dutch Golden Age.  Rachel Ruysch was born on 3 June 1664 in The Hague to the scientist Frederik Ruysch and Maria Post, the daughter of the architect Pieter Post. Her father was also a professor of anatomy and botany and an amateur painter. He had a vast collection of animal skeletons, and mineral and botany samples which Rachel used to practice her drawing skills. At a young age she began to paint the flowers and insects of her father's collection in the popular manner of Otto Marseus van Schrieck. Working from these samples Rachel matched her father's ability to depict nature with great accuracy. Rachel and her sister Anna Ruysch learned to draw and paint within their father's extensive scientific collections, which provided abundant botanical and zoological specimens for study. Both sisters pursued painting careers, although Anna appears to have stopped painting after her marriage, while Rachel continued professionally for more than six decades.   In 1679, at age fifteen, Ruysch was apprenticed to Willem van Aelst, a prominent flower painter in Amsterdam. His studio in Amsterdam looked out over the studio of the flower painter Maria van Oosterwijck. Ruysch studied with van Aelst until his death in 1683. Besides painting technique he taught her how to arrange a bouquet in a vase so it would look spontaneous and less formalized. This technique produced a more realistic and three-dimensional effect in her paintings. By the time Ruysch was eighteen she was producing and selling independently signed works. She would also have known and consorted with the flower painters Jan and Maria Moninckx, Alida Withoos, and Johanna Helena Herolt-Graff, who all were about her age and who worked for the horticulturist Agnes Block and who, like her father, also worked with the plant collectors Jan and Caspar Commelin.  In 1693 she married the Amsterdam portrait painter Juriaen Pool, with whom she had ten children. Throughout her marriage and adult life she continued to paint and produce commissions for an international circle of patrons. Other women at this time were expected to participate in art forms more traditionally practiced by women, such as sewing and spinning. Ruysch continued to work as a painter throughout her marriage, supported by the strong demand for her flower pieces and the high prices they commanded. Her paintings often earned more than the portraits produced by her husband, Juriaen Pool, and her established reputation enabled her to maintain a professional career alongside raising a family.   Ruysch enjoyed great fame within her lifetime, and post-mortem alike. In her lifetime her paintings were sold for prices as high as 750–1200 guilders. In comparison, Rembrandt rarely received more than 500 guilders for a painting in his lifetime.  She died in Amsterdam on 12 October 1750, and remains a widely respected artist.  It is unknown whether Ruysch was a member of the Amsterdam Guild of Saint Luke, but early signed works by her in the 1680s show the influence of Otto Marseus van Schrieck. By 1699 she and her family had moved to The Hague, where she was offered membership in the Confrerie Pictura as their first female member. In 1701 she and her husband became members of The Hague Painter's Guild. In 1708, Ruysch was invited to work for the court in Düsseldorf and serve as court painter to Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. She obtained a contract for works painted at home that she periodically brought to Düsseldorf. She continued working for him and his wife from 1708 until the prince's death in 1716.  Art historians consider Ruysch to be one of the most talented still life artists of either sex. By the time of her death at age 86 she had produced hundreds of paintings, of which more than 250 have been documented or are attributed to her. Her dated works establish that she painted from the age of 15 until she was 83, a few years before her death. Historians are able to establish this with certainty because she included her age when signing her paintings.  Ruysch had a very good understanding of drawing and the techniques of earlier traditions. This knowledge improved her painting abilities.In contrast to many late seventeenth-century Dutch still-life painters, who often favored more restrained and scientifically oriented botanical compositions, Ruysch developed a more dynamic and asymmetrical approach. Her bouquets incorporate twisting stems, suspended blossoms, and lively diagonals that break from the more diagrammatic conventions of botanical illustration.  Every petal was created painstakingly with delicate brushwork. The background of Ruysch's paintings are usually dark which was the fashion for flower painting in the second half of the 17th century. Her asymmetrical compositions with drooping flowers and wild stems created paintings that seemed to possess a great energy about them.  In her early work Ruysch painted a large number of forest floor pictures that feature small animals, reptiles, butterflies, and fungi. Ruysch’s teacher Willem van Aelst introduced her to looser and more spontaneous compositional structures, but she later refined and popularized this manner. Her mature bouquets, with their elaborate layering and rhythmic movement, helped define the evolving taste for more dynamic floral still lifes in the early eighteenth century  She later focused almost exclusively on complex floral bouquets, combining the minute scientific observation learned from her father’s collections with imagined arrangements that could not exist in nature, producing an aesthetic that blended naturalism with invention   The symbolism of each flower was elaborately developed in the 17th century, but most of this concerned the introduction of a single flower into a Vanitas piece. Apart from Jan van Huysum, no 18th-century flower painter matched the skill of Rachel Ruysch.  In 1999 a painting by Ruysch was discovered in a farmhouse in Normandy and was sold at auction for 2.9 million French francs, about US$508,000.  In the twenty-first century, Ruysch’s work has received renewed scholarly and curatorial attention. The exhibition ''Rachel Ruysch: Nature into Art'' (2024-25), organized by the Alte Pinakothek, the Toledo Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, offered the first large-scale international reevaluation of her oeuvre. The accompanying catalogue received the 2024 George Wittenborn Memorial Book Award.   In March 2021, Ruysch's work was added to the ""Gallery of Honour"" at the Rijksmuseum. Ruysch, Gesina ter Borch, and Judith Leyster are the first women to be included in the gallery.  In 2025, the Toledo Museum of Art, Alte Pinakothek, Munich and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston organized the exhibition Rachel Ruysch: Nature into Art.  It was held at the Alte Pinakothek November 26, 2024 – March 16, 2025; Toledo Museum April 12 – July 27, 2025, Museum of Fine Arts (titled Rachel Ruysch: Artist, Naturalist, and Pioneer), August 23–December 7, 2025. The exhibition was accompanied with a catalog Rachel Ruysch Nature into Art, by Robert Schindler, Bernd Ebert, Anna C. Knaap, et al.  The catalog won the 2024 George Wittenborn Memorial Book Award.  ISBN: 978-0-87846-899-7  Many of the plants that appear in Ruysch’s still lifes reached the Dutch Republic through global trade networks that connected Europe to territories in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Botanical species from regions such as Suriname and the Cape Colony were collected, transported, and cultivated so that they could be studied or drawn once they arrived in Amsterdam. These plants were often grown in colonial botanical gardens, and recent scholarship has noted that the labor of enslaved workers played an central role in maintaining these sites and supporting the circulation of rare specimens.  The availability of imported plants shaped the botanical variety seen in Ruysch’s paintings. Amsterdam’s position as a center of global trade created conditions in which artists had access to species from many parts of the world, which were studied in scientific collections and used as models for naturalistic still lifes.",female,The Hague,Amsterdam
Pieter van Schaeyenborgh,Q46998219,"Pieter van Schaeyenborgh (also van Schayenburch, and several other spellings; 1600, Antwerp – 1657, Alkmaar) was a Flemish painter, who worked in the Dutch Republic in the latter part of his career.  He is known for his still lifes of fish.  Few details of his life and career are known. He was born to a family of fishmongers in Antwerp. He has been identified with the Peter Schaeyenborch who was in 1610 registered with the painters' guild (the Guild of Saint Luke) in Antwerp (Antwerpse Sint-Lucasgilde [nl]) as an apprentice of Daniël Christiaenssen.  In 1635, he was registered with the painters' guild in Alkmaar, and was active there until his death. In 1656 and 1657, the executors of the estate of Johan van Nordingen de Jonge (i.e. 'the Younger'; 1625/26-1656) paid him 48 and 56 guilders respectively for two paintings commissioned before van Nordingen's death. He also painted one of the two coats of arms for van Nordingen's grave; he and the other painter, Laurens van Oosthoorn, received 36 guilders each.[a] He taught the marine painter Jan Theunisz Blanckerhoff (1628–1669).  Van Schaeyenborgh, Pieter de Putter and Jan Dirven were among the earliest Netherlandish painters to specialise in still lifes of fish as the main subjects of paintings rather than as incidental features in larger compositions.  He painted still lifes of fish, in oils, said to be very well executed. In 1914, some of his paintings were held on loan by the Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar. Until 1974, that museum held several of his paintings on loan from armenhuis van Nordingen; presumably Huis van Achten [nl] in Alkmaar, which had been founded using a legacy from van Nordingen. As of 2019, the museum displays his Visstilleven met gezicht op Egmond ('Still life of fish with view of Egmond') in its permanent collection.  In 2019, a group of van Schaeyenborgh's paintings was exhibited at the Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar. The catalogue praised his depictions of fish which look as if they have just been caught, with beautiful scales and water droplets you can almost touch.",male,,

Adriana Spilberg,Q512339,"Adriana Spilberg (1652–1700) was a Dutch Golden Age painter active at the court of Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine.  She was born in Amsterdam. According to Houbraken her father Johannes Spilberg taught her to paint in oils, crayon and pastels and she became quite famous in Amsterdam. Spilberg kept her in Amsterdam while he was working for Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. When his patron married Archduchess Maria Anna Josepha of Austria, she asked Spilberg to bring his family, including his famous daughter, to court, which he did, and Adriana became court painter for the archduchess in 1681 in Düsseldorf.

Emanuel Sweert,Q1334797,"Emanuel Sweerts (1552–1612) was a Dutch painter and nurseryman noted for his publication in 1612 at Frankfurt-am-Main of Florilegium Amplissimum et Selectissimum.  Sweerts was born at Zevenbergen and lived in a period when new plants from across the world were being introduced to Europe via Dutch, English and French ships. To meet the burgeoning interest in plants by the public, nurseries were being established by wealthy merchants in order to meet the demand. Botanical illustration suddenly found a new outlet in the production of nursery catalogues. Sweerts prepared his Florilegium as a guide of his available stock for the Frankfurt Fair of 1612. The plates, depicting some 560 bulbs and flowers, were from the Johann Theodore de Bry Florilegium which in turn was based on that by Pierre Vallet. His attractively depicted bulbs sparked their popularity, leading to 6 editions of the work between 1612 and 1647, and a demand which would later result in ""Tulipomania"". At the time of the fair Sweerts was in the employ of Emperor Rudolf II as head of his gardens in Vienna. He borrowed freely from plates that had been published before, so that many of those that appeared in the Florilegium had been cultivated in the gardens of King Henry IV of France at the Louvre. He died in Amsterdam.    This article about a Dutch botanist is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",male,Zevenbergen,Amsterdam
Augustinus Terwesten,Q2234746,"Augustinus Terwesten or Augustinus Terwesten the Elder (4 May 1649 – 21 January 1711) was a Dutch painter, draughtsman, printmaker and art educator. He specialized in portraits, architectural and historical themes. He was known in his time for his decorative paintings in luxurious residences many of which have since disappeared. He left a great many preparatory drawings. He was a co-founder of The Hague Drawing Academy. He worked for a long time in Berlin where he was court painter to Frederick William I of Prussia and one of the cofounders of the Prussian Academy of Arts.  Terwesten was born in The Hague of parents of German origin. His father, Hans Jacob Terwesten or Zurwesten, was originally from Augsburg while his mother Catharina came from Berlin. They had married in The Hague in 1648, where Hans Jacob worked as a goldsmith. The marriage produced ten children, of whom three sons and two daughters survived. Augustinus was the oldest son. Ezaias, the middle son of the family, also worked temporarily in his father's workshop and settled later in Rome as a flower and fruit painter. The youngest brother Mattheus later followed in Augustinus footsteps and often worked together with him on commissions.  In his father's workshop Augustinus learned the art of engraving, goldsmithing and wax modelling. This was followed by two years of apprenticeship with the history painter Nicolaes Willingh, who became court painter to the Great Elector in Berlin in 1667. He then took lessons from Willem Doudyns for two years before setting off on a Grand Tour through Germany to Italy in 1672, where he spent three years.  In Rome he became a member of the painters' circle known as the Bentvueghels, where he earned the nickname ""Patrysvogel"", or partridge, after the story of Perdix by Ovid. He went back to the Hague via France and England, and was gone for a total of 6 years. In 1678, he set up a workshop in the Hague specialized in wall and ceiling decorations. 1682–1683 he helped to set up the Drawing Academy in the Hague set up by the ""Confrerie Pictura"".  In 1692 he became court painter to the son of his former royal patron, Frederick I of Prussia, in Berlin, and talked him into sponsoring an Akademie der Künste. After overseeing the building of this academy which was completed in 1697, he became professor there and lived there until his death in 1711. He taught both of his brothers Elias and Mattheus Terwesten, but also the painters Frans Beeldemaker, Nikolaus Bruno Belau, Andries Bertoen, Jacobus Bisschop, Nicolaes Hooft, and Cornelis Michiarus.

Willem van de Velde the Elder,Q722912,"Willem van de Velde the Elder (1610/11 – 13 December 1693) was a Dutch Golden Age seascape painter, who produced many precise drawings of ships and ink paintings of fleets, but later learned to use oil paints like his son.  Willem van de Velde, known as the Elder, a marine draughtsman and painter, was born in Leiden, the son of a Flemish skipper, Willem Willemsz. van de Velde, and is commonly said to have been bred to the sea. He married Judith Adriaens van Leeuwen in Leiden in 1631.  His three known legitimate children were named Magdalena, born 1632; Willem, known as the Younger, also a marine painter, born 1633 in Leiden; and Adriaen, a landscape painter, baptized in 1636 in Amsterdam. Meanwhile the family lived Korte Koningstraat, close to the harbour, an area known as the Lastage.  His marriage was stormy, at least in its later years. David Cordingly relates that Willem the Elder fathered two children out of wedlock in 1653, one “by his maidservant, and the other by her friend. Nine years later the Elder and his wife went through a legal separation, ‘on account of legal disputes and the most violent quarrels’. The immediate cause of the dispute was his affair with a married woman.” Michael S. Robinson noted that  “on 17/27 July 1662, he and his wife agreed to part. A condition of the separation was that the Elder could recover from his son Adriaen ‘two royal gifts’, presumably gifts from Charles II for work done in England.”  Cordingly’s account further relates that the dispute was still continuing after another ten years, since “in the autumn of 1672 Judith complained to the woman’s husband.” Robinson adds that by 1674 the couple “must have been reconciled”, for at a chance meeting with Pieter Blaeu in Amsterdam in July the Elder explained that he was only visiting for a few days “in order to fetch his wife”.  His son, Adriaen, had died in Amsterdam early 1672, and Willem the Elder was also fetching his grandson, similarly named Adriaen, who was then aged two.  After his move to England, the exact date of which is uncertain, but reportedly at the end of 1672 or beginning of 1673, he is said to have lived with his family in East Lane, Greenwich, and to have used the Queen's House, now part of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, as a studio. Following the accession of William III and Mary II as King and Queen of England, it appears that this facility was no longer provided, and by 1691 he was living in Sackville Street, now close to Piccadilly Circus. He died in London, and was buried in St James's Church, Piccadilly, at the south end of the street. A memorial to him and his son lies with in the church.  He was the official artist of the Dutch fleet for a period, being present at the Four Days Battle, 1–4 June 1666, and the St James's Day Battle, 25 July 1666, to make sketches. In his work on the biographies of artists, Arnold Houbraken quotes Gerard Brandt's biography of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, relating the anecdote where Willem van de Velde asked Admiral de Ruyter permission to have a galley row him around for a good view of the proceedings on the evening of the Four Days battle in 1666. He wasn't the only artist to paint the scenes of this battle, his son, Ludolf Bakhuysen and Pieter Cornelisz van Soest also made paintings of it. This act later was the reason that van Velde gained his marine commission in London. The date, 1672, commonly given for his entry into the service of Charles II of England, was at a time when the Dutch Republic was at war with England (Third Anglo-Dutch War).  According to the inventory Bartholomeus van der Helst owned or stored many paintings by Van de Velde. They lived close to each other (near Nieuwmarkt) and must have been friends.",male,Leiden,Greenwich
Jan Vermeulen,Q17285665,"Johannes van der Molen or Johannes Jan Vermeulen was a still-life painter during the Dutch Golden Age. He was active in Haarlem from 1638 to 1674. His specialty  was the Vanitas, a style of painting meant to symbolize the transience of life. Many of them feature books.  Nothing is known about his artistic training. He is documented for the first time in 1638 in Haarlem. In 1651, he is on an archival list of the Guild of Saint Luke, as a member and a citizen of Haarlem, under the name Johannes van der Meulen.  In 1674, he is recorded in church documents as having been married for the second time, after which no further mention of him has yet been discovered.  Very few works by this artist are known with any certainty. In addition to books, they include scientific objects and musical instruments, with a limited color range.  Paintings with the monogram IVM, dating from 1661 may be his, although some sources say those works belong to an Isaac Vermeulen.

Laurens helped his father draw up the list of 173 members of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke that Vincent van der Vinne produced in 1702. He learned to paint from his father, and his paintings were similar, but he was especially good at painting flower still lifes, many of which he painted for Philips de Flines, who kept a garden with rare plants from the East and West Indies.  According to the RKD he learned to paint from his father, and from the glass painter Pieter Berchem. He became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1685, and was dean in 1722 and 1728.

Paul Vredeman de Vries,Q7154174,"Paul Vredeman de Vries (Antwerp, 1567 – Amsterdam, 1617), was a Flemish painter and draughtsman who specialised in architectural paintings and, in particular, church interiors.  He was a son of the Dutch-born architect, painter and engineer Hans Vredeman de Vries who at the time was working in the Southern Netherlands.  In 1564 his father had fled to Antwerp from Mechelen, where he had been living in order to escape the Inquisition.  He trained with his father who  was as a painter interested in perspective and therefore painted mainly architectural paintings.  He is known to have collaborated with his father in the completion of large assignments. He worked from 1592 to 1595 in Danzig where his father was employed in the design of defensive works.  He worked from 1596 to 1599 in Prague where he painted the ceilings and the reception rooms of Emperor Rudolf II's castle.  He was active in Amsterdam from 1599 to 1617.  There is a record of a notice of marriage between him and Mayken Godelet issued in Amsterdam and dated 24 April 1601. In 1649 she was buried in Nieuwe Kerk. The year her husband died is uncertain; it could be 1630 when his designs for furniture were published or later, but before 1636.  He was the master of Hendrick Aerts and Isaak van den Blocke, both artists of Flemish descent who were living in Gdansk.  His older brother Salomon Vredeman de Vries (1556–1604) was also an architectural draughtsmen and painter who collaborated with him and his father.  Vredeman de Vries specialised in architectural paintings and, in particular, imaginary church interiors and palaces. His paintings show a meticulous attention to perspective. He developed an original poetic vision in his mature years. The facades of palaces that are richly ornate and the colonnades of which open onto flowered courtyards with fountains and sculptures provide the setting for scenes from ancient history or sacred history. The rigour of the geometric composition, which incorporates the principles of the contemporary treatises on perspective, is tempered by an atmospheric rendering of the light with its silvery shimmers. The interiors are a reconstruction of the interior decoration of his day such as chairs trimmed with leather, embossed leather hangings and canopies with valances.  He collaborated with his father on large assignments as well as with other artists such as Frans Francken the Younger, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Dirck de Quade van Ravesteyn (while in Prague), Pieter-Franz Isaaksz and Adriaen van Nieulandt (in Amsterdam).  Vredeman de Vries was also active as an engraver. He contributed some of the 31 engravings to his father's architectural treatise entitled Architectura which was published in 1606. He further made the engravings for a series entitled Verscheyden Schrynwerck als Portalen, Kleerkassen, Buffeten (Various woodwork for porches, wardrobes and cupboards), published in 1630.

Catarina Ykens,Q12156468,"Catarina or Catharina Ykens or Catarina Ykens (II) (1659–1737 or later) was a Flemish painter. The few surviving paintings attributed to her are still lifes but she is also believed to have painted history paintings with biblical themes.  She was born in Antwerp as the daughter of the painter Johannes Ykens and his second wife Barbara Brekevelt and was baptized on 24 February 1659. She was the sister of Peter Ykens, a history and portrait painter. She apprenticed under her father and became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in the guild year 1687–1688.  The record of the Guild mentions that she was a geestelycke dochter (spiritual daughter), a term which refers to an unmarried Catholic woman who took a vow of chastity before a priest, usually obeying, not bound by vows, a superior, also known as her confessor.  It is not clear when she died. A Nativity in Aix-en-Provence is signed and dated 1737. This is her latest known dated work.  She is known for her flower garland paintings, vanitas still lifes as well as history paintings with biblical themes. The few surviving paintings attributed to her are still lifes. Her works are sometimes confused with the works of another Antwerp painter of the same name known as Catarina Ykens (I) (née Floquet), born between 1608 and 1618 in Antwerp, who was the wife of the still life painter Frans Ykens.  She painted garland paintings. Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder in collaboration with the Italian cardinal Federico Borromeo at the beginning of the 17th century. Other artists involved in the early development of the genre included Hendrick van Balen, Andries Daniels, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Catholic Counter-Reformation movement. It was further inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Habsburg Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally.  Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image, portrait or other religious symbol (such as the host). By the second half of the 17th century secular themes such as portraits and mythological subjects also decorated the central part of the many paintings made in this fashion. Two examples of such later development are two signed garland paintings by Catarina Ykens in the Museo del Prado, Madrid: the Flower garland with landscape and the Landscape inside a garland. These works are usually attributed to Catarina (II) but may also have been painted by Catarina (I). The two compositions depict a garland of flowers and leaves surrounding a landscape. In each of these works, the landscape was not painted by Catherine Ykens herself, but the identity of their author(s) is not known.  She is also known for a vanitas still life, a genre of still life which offers a reflection on the meaninglessness of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. This meaning is conveyed in these still lifes through the use of stock symbols, which reference the transience of things and, in particular, the futility of earthly wealth: a skull, soap bubbles, candles, empty glasses, wilting flowers, insects, smoke, watches, mirrors, books, hourglasses and musical instruments, various expensive or exclusive objects such as jewellery and rare shells. The term vanitas is derived from the famous line 'Vanitas, Vanitas. Et omnia Vanitas', in the book of the Ecclesiastes in the bible, which in the King James Version is translated as ""Vanity of vanities, all is vanity"".  The worldview behind vanitas paintings was a Christian understanding of the world as a temporary place of fleeting pleasures and sorrows from which mankind could only escape through the sacrifice and resurrection of Christ. A wheat stalk symbolises, for instance, the resurrection of Christ on which, according to the Christian faith, the salvation of each human being depends. While most of these symbols reference earthly existence (books, scientific instruments, etc.) or the transience of life and death (skulls, soap bubbles) some symbols used in the vanitas paintings carry a dual meaning: the rose refers as much to the brevity of life as it is a symbol of the resurrection of Christ and thus eternal life. Catarina's composition Vanitas bust of a lady with a crown of flowers on a ledge (signed and dated on the ledge: Catharina van ÿkens . filia Devota f. 1688, at Sotheby's London of 6 July 2017, lot 115) contains the typical symbols present in vanitas paintings such as a skull and wilting flowers, but has a distinctive macabre aspect by putting the skull crowned with a wig on a bust and having a bird pick at some berries on a branch pinned to the front of the bust.",female,Antwerp,
